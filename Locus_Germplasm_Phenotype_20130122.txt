AT1G01550	bps1-2	Growth of bps1-2 mutants on CPTA-supplemented medium resulted in partial rescue of both leaf and root defects. bps1-2 mutants grown on control growth medium have small radialized leaves with very little vascular tissue, and very short misshapen knotted-looking roots. By contrast, bps1-2 mutants grown on CPTA-supplemented medium produced larger flattened leaves that contained primary and secondary veins, and smooth elongated roots.	17217459
AT1G01550	bps1-2	Mutant roots were abnormal; primary and lateral roots were short, root hairs formed close to the root apex, and root defects were most severe when plants were grown at low temperature.	15458645
AT1G01550	bps1-2	Mutants produced two radially symmetric organs in the place of leaves; these organs were typically devoid of vascular tissue and lacked trichomes. Prolonged 16°C growth did not result in additional organs being produced, indicating that shoot meristem (SAM) activity was also lost. Mutants grown at 22°C showed a similar, albeit less severe, phenotype. The first leaf pair was slightly larger and flatter than those of 16°C-grown mutants and contained some vascular tissue, and additional radial organs were produced by the SAM. Mutants grown at 29°C showed an even less-severe phenotype; these plants produced flattened, irregularly shaped leaves with slightly lobed margins and an abnormal vein pattern.	15458645

AT1G02340	hfr1-101	Fluence response curves in both R and FR light confirmed that rsf1 seedlings responded normally to R light and are less sensitive to all the tested fluences of FR light. However, unlike phyA null mutants (phyA-211), they clearly responded to increasing fluences of FR light.
	10982420

AT1G02340	hfr1-101	Hypocotyl elongation is less inhibited than in wild-type plants in both FR and blue light. Hypocotyl length in rsf1 seedlings was intermediate between the wild type and a photoreceptor null mutant under both light conditions.	10982420
AT1G02340	hfr1-101	In short days (SD), flowering time is unaffected. rsf1 plants were indistinguishable from wild type both in LD and SD using two criteria to measure flowering time (days until flowering and leaf number at flowering).
	10982420

AT1G02340	hfr1-101	rsf1 mutants accumulated slightly, but significantly lower, levels of anthocyanins than the wild type.	10982420
AT1G02580	mea-1	Heterozygous  embryos abort if the mutant allele is  derived from the female, but develop  normally if it is derived from the male. Embryos derived  from mutant eggs abort irrespective of the  paternal contribution. Thus, the mea  mutant displays maternal-effect embryo lethality.
	9545225

AT1G02580	mea-1	In the homozygous progeny:  During early stages of embryogenesis the  development of mea-1 embryos is indistinguishable  from wild-type siblings in cleared  or sectioned specimens. Visible differences  between wild-type and mea-1 embryos  began at the late globular stage. Globular mea-1 embryos show excess  cell proliferation and enlarge radially  symmetrical. When wild-type embryos  reach the mid to late heart stage, sibling  mea-1 embryos are still globular and contain  small vacuolated cells with curvilinear cell  walls and sometimes irregular cell divisions  in the ground tissue and procambium. Suspensor  and hypophysis are normal, and cotyledons  initiate synchronously as in the  wild type. Thus, despite increased cell proliferation  and occasional irregular cytokinesis,  morphogenetic progression is normal.  However, each stage is prolonged and includes  more division cycles, and morphogenesis  is delayed. As a consequence, giant  heart stage mea-1 embryos  are present along with late torpedo or cotyledonary  stage wild-type embryos. mea-1  heart stage embryos have supernumerary  cell layers. When wild-type siblings are  fully differentiated, most mea-1 embryos  have reached the late heart stage and are up  to 10 times larger than normal. mea embryos  degenerate during desiccation. These results  suggest that mea controls cell proliferation  during embryogenesis, allowing morphogenesis  to progress normally, albeit  slowly.  Endosperm development in mea-1 seeds  is indistinguishable from that of the wild  type at early stages. When cellularization  begins normally in wild-type seeds at the  transition from the globular to the heart  stage, no cellularization is observed in sibling  mea-1 seeds. Although nuclear divisions  take place more slowly in mea-1 endosperm,  the distribution of endosperm nuclei  is as in the wild type. Partial cellularization  occurs at the micropyle when mea-1  embryos reach the late heart stage in desiccating  seeds, but because fewer nuclei have  been generated, most of the centra	9545225
AT1G02580	mea-1	The homozygous progeny is embryo-lethal.	9545225
AT1G02580	mea-2	Mutant homozygous mea embryo  sacs accumulated 45 times more maternal transcripts  than wild-type before fertilization,  and it persisted after fertilization (7.5 times more transcripts  4 d after pollination.

AT1G02860	bah1-D	Exhibits spontaneous cell death in leaves after bolting and increased salicylic acid levels and localized cell death after inoculation with Pst DC3000.	18753285
AT1G02860	nla	In contrast to wild type, anthocyanin accumulation did not occur in the senescing mutant rosette leaves.	17355433
AT1G02860	nla	Mutants failed to adapt to the conditions of nitrogen limitation and started senescence much earlier and more rapidly than did wild-type plants supplied with 3 mM nitrate: mutant plants supplied with 10 mM nitrate had a similar pattern of growth and development to wild type. When the nitrate concentration was reduced to 3 mM, the mutant plants started senescence in the fifth rosette leaf at 24 DAG, and after this point senescence progressed rapidly with all rosette leaves showing senescence symptoms at 26 DAG, and the whole rosette dying at 32 DAG. In contrast, wild-type plants displayed no senescence symptoms in the fifth rosette leaf until 32 DAG. In wild-type plants, the process of senescence proceeded slowly and gradually from the fifth to the youngest rosette leaves, and it took at least 2 weeks for all rosette leaves to show the senescence symptoms.	17355433
AT1G02860	nla	The cauline leaves in the mutant plants started senescence at 28 DAG, at least 10 days earlier than those in the wild-type plants. Further, the developing mutant siliques initiated senescence in their tips at 32 DAG, while the wild-type siliques showed no senescence symptoms  throughout their development but accumulated abundant anthocyanin which was not observed in the mutant siliques.	17355433
AT1G02860	nla	The early senescence process was arrested when nitrate was added after depletion.	17355433
AT1G02860	nla	The occurrence (at 24 DAG) and progression (at 28 DAG) of senescence in mutant rosette leaves were not accompanied by a significant reduction in the amounts of nitrogen-containing compounds: nitrate, total amino acids, soluble proteins, and total nitrogen. By contrast, they were largely reduced in the wild-type plants.	17355433
AT1G02860	nla	With the reduction of the nitrate concentration to 1 mM, the occurrence of the senescence phenotype in the rosette leaves of mutant plants was accelerated to 20 DAG, and severe senescence in the developing mutant siliques resulted in their death around 30 DAG without producing viable seeds. Under the same growth condition (1 mM nitrate), wild-type plants did not start senescence in their rosette leaves until 26 DAG, and produced fecund siliques.	17355433
AT1G02880	AtTPK1-KO	The AtTPK1-KO single mutant does not have any obvious aberrant phenotypes, but, the AtTPK1-KO /AtTPK2-KO double mutant demonstrates that these enzymes are required to produce thiamine pyrophosphate from thiamine.	17611796
AT1G02880	AtTPK1/2-KO	These double knock-out mutants are thiamine auxotrophs that have a seedling lethal phenotype unless they are supplied with exogenous thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) through a spray-based application. In addition, these mutants have 2-fold higher levels of thiamine and 32-fold lower levels of TPP than wild type plants.	17611796
AT1G02910	lpa1	The leaves of the mutant are paler than those of the wild type, and growth is significantly reduced. The leaf area of the mutant is ~75% lower than that of wild-type plants 26 d after germination.	16531500

AT1G02910	lpa1	Wild-type chloroplasts are larger than those of the mutant and have a larger number of discs per grana stack on average. In addition, the wild-type chloroplasts display well-developed membrane systems composed of grana connected by the stroma lamellae, but the thylakoid membrane systems in mutant chloroplasts are disturbed, and the membrane spacing is not as clear.	16531500
AT1G02970	wee1-1	significant decreased root elongation rates, densely clustered hairs at the root tip and outgrowth of lateral roots	17209125
AT1G03000	pex6	Resistant to root elongation inhibition by IBA but responds normally to IAA.  Fails to respond to the stimulatory effects of IBA on lateral root initiation but makes lateral roots in response to IAA.  Specifically defective in IBA responses.  Has several peroxisome-defective phenotypes:  does not develop normally without exogenous sucrose, dramatic defects in hypocotyl and root elongation in the absence of sucrose. Shorter root and hypocotyl than WT.  Plants grown in soil have smaller rosettes, fewer rosette leaves, and shorter primary inflorescence stems than WT.  Also has shorter siliques containing fewer seeds than WT.  Pale green in color.	14745029
AT1G03060	spi-11	Trichome cells have shorter branches, reduced stalk length and width.  Epidermal pavement cells are less complex, with less lobing.  Root hairs are shorter and root hair vacuoles are fragmented.	19392685

AT1G03160	SALK_009051	Similar to SALK_033745 line	16617119
AT1G03160	SALK_033745	The leaves were visibly pale, and flowering was delayed by 5-7 days compared with the wild type plants. Mature mesophyll cells in mutant leaves contained fewer, larger chloroplasts than in wild type, and these were heterogeneous in size. This phenotype was more pronounced in older than in younger leaves. Mesophyll cell chloroplasts in wild type and mutant plants also differed ultrastructurally. In mutants, grana lamellae were less uniform in length and stacked in a staggered fashion, giving rise to a disorganized thylakoid array. Stroma thylakoids appeared less abundant than in wild type chloroplasts. In contrast, stroma thylakoids in mutants were similar in length to those in wild type but constituted a smaller proportion of the total thylakoid network.	16617119

In the surface-inoculated mutant, the bacterial <i>cor</i> mutant multiplied efficiently.	16959575
AT1G16540	CS157	Stomata of the mutant are greatly compromised in their ability to respond to either <i>Pst</i> DC3000 or <i>Pst</i> DC300/<i>avrRpt2</i>, suggesting that ABA biosynthesis is required for stomatal closure in response to these bacteria.	16959575

Less responsive to light as measured by hypocotyl elongation and enhanced cotyledon expansion in red, blue and far red light meaning they are less responsive. Early flowering. Increased levels of 6-deoxotyphasterol and cataseterone, which are products of the brassiolide pathway.	15773851
AT1G17110	ubp15-1	ubp15-1 mutants exhibit several anatomical defects related to leaf, root, flower, stem, and silique development. Notably, rosette leaves are narrow and serrated. An examination of ubp15-1 leaf cross-sections reveals a reduction in the number of adaxial epidermal and palisade cells spanning the width of the leaf. ubp15-1 mutant leaves also have fewer spongy cell layers than wild type leaves. The aberrant phenotype of this mutant is exacerbated when it is crossed with ubp16-1.	18485060
AT1G17170	gst	As for the root growth assay, the root elongation of both the mutant and the wild-type was inhibited at lower concentrations of TNT than 2,6-DNT.

AT1G17440	eer4; ein3-1	eer4 partially restores the ethylene responsiveness to the ein3-1 mutant. Exposure of the eer4;ein3-1 mutant to saturating levels of ethylene results in moderate hypocotyl inhibition along with the generation of a pronounced apical hook.	17526916
AT1G17440	eer4;ein2-5	Identical to the ein2-5 single mutant.There is no noticeable effect on hypocotyl length of dark grown plants supplemented with ethylene.	17526916
AT1G17580	SALK_019031C	There are no obvious defects in the aerial tissues, roots, or root hairs of xi-1 mutant plants grown under normal conditions. There are also no obvious defects in organelle trafficking, except for a slight effect on peroxisome movement. Double mutant analysis reveals a greater role for XI-1 in organelle movement and plant development (see xik-2/xi-1).	18178669
AT1G17580	xi-k / xi-1	The xi-k / xi-1 double mutant plants are shorter and have smaller rosettes than wild type plants. Their reduced leaf size results from decreased cell size and decreased cell number. These double mutants produce fewer seeds per silique than wild type plants. In the leaf epidermis, Golgi stacks, peroxisomes, and mitochondria move more slowly in these mutant cells than in wild-type cells. Root hair length is reduced to ~35% of the wild type root hair length in these double mutants, but their root hair density is very similar to the wild type density.	19060218

AT1G18330	SAIL_195_F11 (homo)	Under both FRc and Rc conditions, the length of mutant hypocotyls and cotyledon area are similar to that of wild type.	16891401
AT1G18350	bud1	bud1 plants develop significantly fewer  lateral roots, simpler venation patterns, and a quicker and greater curvature in the gravitropism assay. In addition, the bud1  plants have shorter hypocotyls at high temperature (29C) under light, which is a characteristic feature of defective auxin  action. Determination of tritium-labeled indole-3-acetic acid transport showed that the increased expression of MKK7 in bud1  or the repressed expression in MKK7 antisense transgenic plants causes deficiency or enhancement in auxin transport,  indicating that MKK7 negatively regulates polar auxin transport.	16377756
AT1G18450	arp4	arp4-1 mutation causes partial sterility. Homozygous mutants had poorly developed siliques with a few or no seeds, compared with heterozygous mutant or wild type siliques that were fully filled with seeds. Flowers on the homozygous sterile plants were often slightly smaller and open for considerably longer periods than wild type, and a majority of them (80 to 90%) remained unfertilized. Otherwise, mutant plants revealed only mild very morphological and developmental phenotypes. The anthers from the sterile plants were often smaller, more heart shaped, and contained fewer pollen grains compared with wild type anthers, which were somewhat oblong and fully filled with pollen In addition, the mutant pollen grains were slightly larger than wild type. Because the mutant stamens often had shorter filaments than the wild type self-pollination was seldom efficient. However, upon manual pollination, pollen from the homozygous mutant plants germinated on self or wild type stigmas and produced fertile seeds, indicating that the mutant pollen grains, although larger, were viable. When homozygous mutant plant was pollinated with wild type pollen, the cross-pollination resulted in near normal development of siliques and production of seeds suggesting that the female development was not affected by the arp4-1 mutation. Sterility in the homozygous mutant plants is the result of production of fewer pollen and inefficient self-pollination. Mutant plants had a 35 to 40% reduction in the amount of AtARP4 protein compared with wild type.	15743449

However, after 7 DAG, the elongation of the double mutant roots was dramatically reduced compared with the wild-type roots. The aerial organs (leaves, rosettes, inflorescences, flowers, fruits, and embryos) developed normally in the double mutant plants.

Also, the roots and hypocotyls of the double mutant show reduced gravitropic curvatures compared with the wild type when vertically dark-grown seedlings are reoriented by 90°.	15659631
AT1G19220	CS24627	The phenotype of the double mutant is most obvious at its seedling stage, with its most prominent phenotype being severely impaired  lateral root formation. Its primary roots fail to produce lateral roots in 2-week-old seedlings. However, double mutant seedlings start to generate several lateral roots after ~2 weeks of growth, and their morphological appearance is normal.	15659631

AT1G28300	CS3868	Embryo lethal, embryos not viviparous, cotyledons partially transformed into leaves, complex vascular pattern observed in cotyledons. Embryos are sensitive to abscisic acid. Mutant seeds were usually desiccation tolerant at maturity, although their viability was reduced slightly after several weeks of storage. Dry seeds often germinated to produce seedlings with distorted cotyledons. This defect resulted from degeneration of cotyledon tips prior to germination. Some trichomes form on cotyledons after germination and stomata are found on surface of cotyledons of mutant embryos The cotyledon surface on seedlings produced from dry seeds lacked trichomes (likely because any trichomes initiated during embryogenesis did not survive desiccation). Mutant seeds were consequently highly pigmented at maturity and anthocyanins were especially prominent in the top half of the mutant cotyledons. Mutant embryos do not form roots during the first 48 hours of culture. The pattern of storage product accumulation was altered, the hypocotyl was filled with mature protein bodies, while the cotyledons exhibited a gradient of starch and protein accumulation. Cells in the top half of mutant cotyledons were highly vacuolated, packed with starch grains, and lacked mature protein bodies, whereas cells closer to the hypocotyl contained less starch but many protein bodies. The accumulation of lipid bodies during embryogenesis was unusual too: distribution of lipid bodies was highly abundant in the hypocotyls of the mutant plants.	12244265

AT1G28560	srd2	temperature-sensitive mutant. srd2 seedlings grown at  the permissive temperature (22C) appeared almost normal. At 28C,  both hypocotyl and root explants of the srd2 mutant could  not establish shoot apical meristems de novo. When  primary root segments of srd2 were cultured on root-inducing  medium (RIM) at 28C, abnormal lateral root primordia  lacking functional apical meristems were frequently observed.  except that they had fewer lateral roots than the wild-type  seedlings. At the restrictive temperature (28C however, the development of true leaves and primary roots in srd2  seedlings was severely interrupted. Whereas root explants of the srd2 mutant formed  calli on callus-inducing medium (CIM), at either 22Cor 28C,  callus formation from srd2 hypocotyl explants was strongly  inhibited at 28C	16098103

AT1G29920	SALK_134810C	The mutant shows ABA insensitivity in stomatal movement, including promotion of stomatal closure and inhibition of stomatal opening. The detached leaves of the mutant lose more water than those of the wild-type plants under dehydration condition; both young seedlings and mature plants of the mutant have lower capacity to conserve water during drought stress in comparison with wild-type plants. The ROS levels increase in the mutant in comparison with wild-type plants in both the whole leaves and in guard cells. Treatment with low concentrations of ABA reduces ROS levels in both whole leaves(1 to 10 uM ABA application) and in guard cells(5 uM ABA application) in the mutant plants.	22143917

The detached leaves of the double mutant lose more water than those of wild-type plants under dehydration condition, and that both young seedlings and mature plants of the double mutant have lower capacity to conserve their water during drought stress in comparison with wild-type plants. The ROS levels increase in the double mutants in comparison with wild-type plants in both the whole leaves and in guard cells. Low concentrations ABA treatments reduce ROS levels of double mutents in both whole leaves(1 to 10 &#956;M ABA application) and in guard cells(5 &#956;M ABA application).	22143917
AT1G29990	pdf6-1	Seedlings exhibit root swelling when grown in the presence of 100 nM oryzalin and have a 25% reduction in hypocotyl length. Reduced cell size is due to defects in the microtubules.

AT1G30270	cipk23-1	Enhanced drought tolerance. Hypersensitive to ABA inhibition  of light-induced stomatal opening. Loss of function of CIPK23 alters the ABA  responsiveness of guard cells during their opening and  closure, leading to reduced water loss under drought  conditions. When grown on media containing low levels of KCl (micromolar  range), cipk23 mutants displayed drastically reduced  stature compared to the wild-type. In particular, the roots of  mutant plants were significantly shorter than those of wildtype  plants.	17922773

AT1G32240	bop1-4 bop2-11 kan1-2 kan2-1	About nine-tenths of the mutants exhibited abaxialized vasculature. The exclusively adaxialized vasculature observed in kan1 kan2 petioles was not detected in bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 petioles. The radialized portion of bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 leaves showed various kinds of organ polarity defects. The vascular bundles of nearly half of the leaves (44.0%) consisted of phloem surrounded by xylem, while one-third (36.0%) displayed xylem surrounded by phloem, and a small percentage (16.0%) had a mixture of both types of vasculature.
	17601823

AT1G32240	bop1-4 bop2-11 kan1-2 kan2-1	Quadruple mutant plants developed narrow leaves with ectopic blade outgrowth along the petioles, like bop1 bop2 leaves, as well as ectopic outgrowths on their abaxial lamina, like kan1 kan2 leaves. However, all of the bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 leaves also showed extended, radialized petiole development that was not observed in either parental genotype.
	17601823

AT1G32240	bop1-4 bop2-11 kan1-2 kan2-1	bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 stems had a decreased ratio of adaxialized vascular phenotypes compared with kan1 kan2 stems. Similar to what was observed in petioles, 6.7% of bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 stems exhibited an abaxialized phenotype of xylem surrounded by phloem, while others (13.3%) had both types of vasculature in a single stem.	17601823
AT1G32240	kan1 kan2 ats	Similar to kan1 kan2 double mutant.  However, the ovules have a novel phenotype, forming a single amorphous structure in place of both integuments.	16623911

AT1G32240	kan1-2 kan2-1	Cotyledons are narrow, cup-shaped and point upward. Leaves are narrow, dark green and develop ectopic outgrowths on their abaxial side only.  Four to six stipules, rather than two, develop at the base of each leaf, surrounding its entire circumference.  Stems fail to elongate upon flowering.  Floral organ morphology is highly abnormal.  Mature ovules have reduced outer integuments. Aberrant positioning of cell types, primarily along the adaxial/abaxial lateral organ axis.	11525739
AT1G32240	kan1-2 kan2-1	Double mutant plants have narrow leaves and developed ectopic outgrowths on their abaxial lamina.
	17601823

AT1G32240	kan1-2 kan2-1	External structures of the carpel are largely absent.  Ovules arise from a surface or column of tissue at the center of the flower. The inner integuments of these ovules are normal but the asymmetrical outer integument is now a nearly symmetrical and relatively amorphous collar of tissue.	16623911
AT1G32240	kan1-2 kan2-1	The vasculature in more than half (55.9%) of kan1 kan2 leaf petioles exhibited a pattern of phloem surrounded by xylem, representing an adaxialized phenotype. However, very surprisingly, 17.6% of kan1 kan2 leaf petioles had abaxialized vasculature or a mixture of adaxialized and abaxialized vasculature.	17601823

AT1G32500	SALK_055996	Homozygous offsprings of the T-DNA line show a characteristic set of phenotypes. The chlorophyll content is reduced to 75% compared to wild type. Plants appear slightly bleached. The ultrastructure of the plastids is conspicuously different to wild type plastids. Most evident is the structure of the thylakoids, which are reduced and the grana are unorganized compared to the wild type situation. The overall architecture of mutant homozygous plants is slightly altered compared to wild type. Roots of 6 day-old seedlings were 35% shorter on average. The main macroscopic effect of the mutation is that mutant plants produce a large amount of aborted seeds. Only about 60% of the mature seeds contain phenotypically normal, viable embryos. Up to 30% of the seeds are aborted, dark and shrunken, and do not germinate. Most of these aborted seeds contain embryos arrested at the globular stage as well as ball/oblong-shaped embryos (ca. 75%). The morphogenesis of these embryos was blocked before initiation of cotyledon growth and establishment of bilateral symmetry. The other aborted seeds contain embryos arrested at the torpedo or bent cotyledon stage with abnormal- shaped, thickened hypocotyls and underdeveloped cotyledons (ca. 25%). About 10% of all seeds are narrow, containing undersized, tenuous embryos which are not viable.	15710401

Cells fail to stop elongation and to  adopt the rigid, rectangular morphology of COL cells.   When compared with smb-3, the triple mutant has thesame number of complete LRC layers, and the appearance of the cells in those layers closely resembles that in smb-3. However, partial remains of older LRC layers remain attached to the meristem in the triple mutant, giving it a messy appearance. Remains of old LRC cap layers can be  found still attached to the root along its whole length.

AT1G34210	serk1-1 serk2-1	double mutants were not able to produce seeds because of a lack of pollen  development in mutant anthers. In young buds, double mutant anthers developed normally, but serk1 serk2 microsporangia  produced more sporogenous cells that were unable to develop beyond meiosis. Furthermore, serk1 serk2 double mutants  developed only three cell layers surrounding the sporogenous cell mass, whereas wild-type anthers developed four cell layers.  Further confocal microscopic and molecular analyses showed that serk1 serk2 double mutant anthers lack development  of the tapetal cell layer, which accounts for the microspore abortion and male sterility.	16284306

AT1G48920	parl1-1	parl1-1 mutants, initially identified based on their aberrant parallel venation pattern in juvenile leaves, exhibit several other developmental defects. They have abnormal venation patterns in their cotyledons, adult leaves, petals, and sepals. In addition, they are shorter, have abnormal leaf shapes, and have reduced apical dominance, rosette size, fertility, and root length compared to wild type plants.  The normal adaxial/abaxial arrangement of xylem and phloem is maintained in parl1-1 mutant leaves, but, they have a reduced palisade mesophyll layer in the leaf. There are aberrant expression patterns for the DR5:GUS reporter and the Athb8:GUS reporter in the parl1-1 mutants.	17369435
AT1G48920	parl1-2	par1-2 mutants have defects in leaf venation patterns, as well as several other developmental defects including reduced stature, reduced apical dominance, and reduced fertility relative to wild type plants.

AT1G49430	lacs1-1 lacs2-3	The lacs1-1 lacs2-3 double mutants had a synergistic phenotype, compared to either of the single mutants, with drastically reduced stem wax and cutin contents, increased cuticle permeability, and severe male sterile in low humidity.	19392700
AT1G49430	lacs2-1	Mutant leaves were small and irregular in shape compared with the wild type. Both surfaces of mutant leaves differed from the wild type. Adaxial surfaces of the wild type showed the characteristic jigsaw puzzle shape of pavement cells. In the mutant, the cells contained fewer, larger lobes. Epidermal cells on the abaxial surface of mutants were collapsed. This collapsed appearance was consistently seen in views of the abaxial leaf surface of mutant plants but was never observed on the abaxial surface of wild-type leaves or on the adaxial surfaces of either the wild-type or mutant plants.	14973169
AT1G49430	lacs2-1	Mutant rosettes were slower to flower than wildtype plants (34.1 d versus 30.2 d under a 16-h photoperiod). Mutant plants produced smaller bolts, but flower morphology and fertility were normal, and siliques were similar in size to those on wild-type plants. The smaller bolts of the mutant yielded only 62 mg seed/plant compared with 177 mg seed/plant from wild-type controls. Harvested mutant seeds appeared smaller and darker than seeds from wild-type plants that had been grown alongside the mutants. Examination by light microscopy revealed that 50% of mutant seeds contained green embryos that could be distinguished through the testa. When the green and normal brown seeds from a mutant plant were germinated separately, the green seeds showed 79% germination compared with 100% germination for the brown seeds.	14973169
AT1G49430	lacs2-1	Only 80.0% of mutant seedlings emerged. At 6 d, a percentage of the emerged mutant seedlings would not grow and develop into viable plants. These seedlings had white cotyledons, and they eventually died. At 19 d, 91.0% of the wild-type seeds that germinated had produced viable rosettes with four to five pairs of true leaves. For the mutants, only 72.2% of seeds that had germinated (58% of those sown) produced rosettes. At this stage, the mutant had only two to three pairs of true leaves.	14973169
AT1G49430	lacs2-1	Reduced-growth phenotype.	14973169
AT1G49430	lacs2-1	The cutin layer on the adaxial surface of mutant leaves was not significantly different in cross-sectional thickness from that of control wild-type leaves. However, the abaxial cutin layer on mutant leaves was substantially thinner than the wild type.	14973169
AT1G49430	lacs2-1	The rate of chlorophyll leaching from mutant plants was threefold higher than the rate from wild-type controls.	14973169
AT1G49430	lacs2-2	Increased cuticle permeability compared with WT.	17396154
AT1G49430	lacs2-2	Strongly resistant to infection with Botrytis cinerea strain: infection sites on mutant leaves remained usually symptom free, in contrast to those on Col leaves.	17396154
AT1G49430	lacs2-3	A number of ester-bound monomers were reduced in the mutant.	17396154
AT1G49430	lacs2-3	Increased resistance to Botrytis infection: the visual phenotypes of the leaves 3 days after inoculation show that the lesions larger than the original infection site represent only 5% of lesions compared to 75% in WT plants.	17396154
AT1G49430	lacs2-3	Similar phenotype to that described for lacs2-2.	17396154
AT1G49430	lacs2-3	The distinct osmium-dense cuticular membrane  representing insoluble lipid-derived polymers such as cutin, visible at the epidermal outer extracellular matrix of WT plants, could not be seen at the leaf epidermis of the mutant. The remaining outer epidermal extracellular matrix sometimes had a distinct laminated structure.	17396154
AT1G49430	lacs2-3	The mutant showed severe damage at a lower concentration of BASTA compared with WT Col-0 plants.	17396154
AT1G49430	lacs2-3	The rate of water loss from the mutant is significantly higher than that of Col-0 plants.	17396154
AT1G49430	lacs2-3	The total amount of omega-hydroxylated fatty acids and their derivatives was reduced 4- to 5-fold in the mutant compared with Col-0. The impact of mutation on the amount of dicarboxylic acids, characteristic of Arabidopsis cutin, was particularly strong, and the amount was reduced to 15-20% of WT amount.	17396154
AT1G49820	mtk/eto3	etiolated seedlings of both wild type and mtk mutants have very low emission of ethylene. The eto3 mutant on the other hand has much higher emission of ethylene. The mtk/eto3 double mutant has a intermediate level of ethylene emission. Since mtk is involved in methionine recycle, the double mutant phenotype indicated that methionine recycle is required to sustain high rates of ethylene synthesis.	17144895

Binucleate mutant pollen contained two free nuclei and remained uncellularized. Mature mutant embryo sacs showed various numbers (2 to 5) of nuclei located toward the micropylar pole without visible cellular boundaries. After fertilization, mutant embryo sacs did not develop further and remained uncellularized. At early bicellular pollen stage, approximately 1/3 of dividing microspores had incomplete callose walls, which were correctly positioned at the generative cell pole but do not persist and are degraded before mid-bicellular pollen stage. Subsequently, at mid-bicellular pollen stage, when the generative cell nucleus is highly condensed in wild-type, in approximately 1/3 of mutant pollen, the smaller generative pole nucleus remains round and relatively uncondensed and does not divide further.	16332535

AT1G55350	dek1-2	Severity of the phenotype varied between individual mutant seed. In the most severely affected seed, no embryo development could be detected. In such seeds the endosperm develops and cellularizes but fails to differentiate a complete peripheral (aleurone-like) surface layer. In less severe mutant seed, embryos develop to the globular stage before developmental arrest. In these embryos the plane of cell division is frequently uncontrolled compared to wild-type, the embryo proper is irregular, lacking a well defined L1 cell layer. In mutant seed developing an embryo, the endosperm completes the cellularization process and differentiates an aleurone- like layer in the micropylar chamber around the embryo, but this differentiation frequently stops towards the central chamber Wild-type development occurs in about 75% of seeds of the siliques from which mutant seeds were harvested.	15647902

AT1G62360	stm-1 trn2-23010	30 from a total of 40 seedlings (75%) developed at least one leaf 8 days after germination and all double mutant progeny developed leaves by day 20. In 19 stm-1 trn2-23010 double mutant seedlings, leaves initiated from the base of the cotyledons, which were always fused due to lack of early STM activity. In the remaining 21 double mutant progeny single leaves or side shoots arose laterally, from the outside of the fused base of the petioles instead of being initiated from the shoot apex and thus resembled stm-1 mutant side shoots which are initiated after a long delay.	17351828

AT1G62750	sco1	Chloroplast differentiation was severely impaired in cotyledons but not in true leaves during early seedling growth, giving rise to the seedlings with white cotyledons. In sco1 chloroplast biosynthesis is slowed down leading to a delayed greening in cotyledons. Seed germination was delayed too in both, dark-grown seeds and light exposed seeds. Adult mutant plants had flowering time delayed for a week, while plant senescence was not affected. Mutant plants had reduced fresh weight throughout the life cycle. Seed set was affected too; mutant plants had reached only 40% of amount of seeds produced by the wild type plants.	16525888

AT1G68725	atagp19	Leaves, stems and sepals were lighter green than WT plants throughout the life cycle. Pigment content analyses demonstrated that mutant rosette leaves contained less chlorophyll and anthocyanin compared to WT.
	17217456

AT1G68725	atagp19	Mutant had fewer rosette leaves compared to WT plants at the same age. Moreover, mutant rosette leaves were smaller and more round and had shorter petioles than WT.
	17217456

AT1G68725	atagp19	Mutant hypocotyls were 75% of the length of WT hypocotyls when grown under long-day conditions, which corresponded to a reduction in hypocotyl cell length but not cell number. However, hypocotyl length was not compromised when mutant seedlings were grown in the dark.	17217456
AT1G68725	atagp19	The mutant had shorter, more slender  inflorescence stems with fewer auxillary branches and side bolts. Mutant produced fewer flowers than WT and had fewer and shorter siliques, fewer seeds per silique and a higher percentage of sterile siliques, resulting in less seed production. More than half of the mutant flowers were fertile, and although they were smaller than WT flowers, they opened normally and had normal arrangements and numbers of floral organs. Some sterile flowers were open, while others remained closed. One reason for sterility was the failure of the stamens to elongate beyond the pistil at floral stage 14, whereas, in WT, the stamens were longer than the pistil and brushed against the stigma to allow pollination and fertilization.	17217456

The abnormal flower phenotype has been reported to occur in a fraction of the transgenic plants derived from the Madison collection, and is thought to be linked to the presence of an AP1 sequence in the T-DNA.	17461783
AT1G68765	ida	Ethylene-sensitive mutant, floral organs remain attached to the plant body after the shedding of mature seeds, even though a floral abscission zone develops. No other developmental processes were affected. When grown on the medium containing ethylene (10 ppm), mutant seedlings response was limited to lack of abscission in senescenced floral organs.

	17601829

AT1G70070	ise2-1	Homozygous mutant seeds can germinate in vitro on agar plates containing Murashige and Skoog (MS) salt plus 1% sucrose, although the  growth/developmental rate of the homozygous seedlings was slower compared with that of wild-type seedlings. Whereas wild-type seedlings displayed fully expanded green cotyledons, true leaves and a well-developed root system by 14 d after germination, homozygous seedlings were much smaller and white or pale green in color. Underdeveloped cotyledons emerged from the homozygous seeds but expanded very slowly and sometimes showed bumpy irregular surfaces and occasional anthocyanin expression. Partial greening was observed in ise2 seedlings only after culture for several weeks. Most of the homozygous seedlings developed leaf-like structures that were translucent and contained trichomes. The aerial portions of the homozygous seedlings generally were stunted and thicker and frequently exhibited callus-like structures after extended periods of culture. Mutant seedlings often form stunted inflorescence shoot- and flower-like organs but normal-looking roots and root hairs. Frequently, multiple short shoots originate from the apical dome of a single original seedling, forming a broccoli-like structure. Homozygous seedlings grown in culture with 1% sucrose are sterile and perish immediately after germinating in soil or on MS medium without sucrose.	17601829
AT1G70070	ise2-1	In all homozygous embryos from late-heart to late-torpedo stages, 15% of their plasmodesmata (PD) exhibited branched morphology, in contrast with the single simple PD observed in wild-type embryos. Branched PD were randomly distributed throughout the whole body of embryos, and no variation in their frequency was observed among late-heart, early-torpedo, and late-torpedo stages.

AT1G70560	sav3-1	These mutants have shorter hypocotyls than wild-type plants when grown in low R:FR ratio light. sav3-1 mutants are shorter and have reduced leaf hyponasty compared to wild type plants when both are subjected to supplementary far red light. Shade-induced expression of IAA19 and IAA29 is reduced in this mutant compared to wild-type plants.	18394996
AT1G70560	sav3-2	These mutants have shorter hypocotyls, shorter petioles, and more leaf area than wild-type plants when grown in low R:FR ratio light. They mutants have 60% of the free auxin normally found in wild-type mutants with a marked reduction in IAA synthesis rate under shade conditions. Microarray experiments indicate that following shade treatment, the sav3-2 mutant has 66 genes that are expressed at a lower level than in WT plants. Shade-induced expression of IAA19 and IAA29 is reduced in this mutant compared to wild-type plants, but the wild-type expression level can be restored with 1 uM IAA.	18394996
AT1G70560	sav3-3	These mutants have shorter hypocotyls than wild-type plants when grown in low R:FR ratio light. Shade-induced expression of IAA19 and IAA29 is reduced in this mutant compared to wild-type plants.	18394996
AT1G70560	wei8-1	The hypocotyl of this mutant responds normally to ACC when grown in the dark, but, its roots are moderately less sensitive to ACC than wild type seedlings grown under the same conditions. This difference in sensitivity can be eliminated when the mutants are treated with ACC and low levels of IAA. wei8-1 and wild type hypocotyls and roots respond similarly to IAA in the absence of ACC. The roots of wei8-1 mutant seedlings do not display proper gravitropism. High-temperature mediated hypocotyl elongation is reduced by ~25% in these mutants compared to wild-type seedlings.	18394997
AT1G70560	wei8-1 tar1-1 tar2-1	These triple mutants do not make a primary root, they have an extremely reduced hypocotyl, and they lack discernible vasculature in their cotyledons. These mutants have a higher propensity to develop a single cotyledon than wild-type embryos.	18394997
AT1G70560	wei8-1 tar2-1	The roots of this mutant show almost no sensitivity to the ethylene precursor ACC, but sensitivity is largely restored by the addition of low levels of IAA (but not tryptophan). ACC-triggered dark-grown apical hook formation is also compromised in this mutant, and it is not restored by the addition of IAA. Root gravitropism is more disrupted in this double mutant than in either single mutant. The mutant plants are shorter than wild type, have reduced venation in their leaves, exhibit reduced apical dominance, and produce abnormal flowers. DR5:GUS expression is also diminished in these double mutants, consistent with a ~50% reduction in IAA levels in these mutants. Root meristematic cells differentiate in this mutant, leading to a loss of the stem cell niche and the cessation of root growth.	18394997
AT1G70560	wei8-1 tar2-2	ACC-triggered dark-grown apical hook formation is compromised in this mutant. Root meristematic cells differentiate in this mutant, leading to a loss of the stem cell niche and the cessation of root growth. This mutant also lacks valves in the gynoecia.	18394997
AT1G70560	wei8-2	The hypocotyl of this mutant responds normally to ACC when grown in the dark, but, its roots are moderately less sensitive to ACC than wild type seedlings grown under the same conditions.

AT1G71100	rsw10	Roots of the mutants are similar to those of wild type when grown at 21°C. After transfer to 31°C, their roots progressively increase in diameter between day s 5 and 9. Extended treatment at this temperature leads to the drastic reduction in root elongation and of the elongation zone itself.	17059404

AT1G71830	serk1-1 serk2-1	double mutants were not able to produce seeds because of a lack of pollen  development in mutant anthers. In young buds, double mutant anthers developed normally, but serk1 serk2 microsporangia  produced more sporogenous cells that were unable to develop beyond meiosis. Furthermore, serk1 serk2 double mutants  developed only three cell layers surrounding the sporogenous cell mass, whereas wild-type anthers developed four cell layers.  Further confocal microscopic and molecular analyses showed that serk1 serk2 double mutant anthers lack development  of the tapetal cell layer, which accounts for the microspore abortion and male sterility.	16284306

AT1G73360	edt1	edt1 mutant plants show enhanced drought tolerance due to overexpression of the HDG11 protein. edt1 mutants have a longer primary root with more lateral roots, and have a higher root biomass. They have larger epidermal cells and larger stomata, but a lower stomatal density. Nevertheless, they have higher levels of photosynthesis than WT seedlings. Mutant seedlings accumulate higher levels of ABA following PEG treatment, and show constitutively higher levels of Pro. Superoxide dismutase activity is also higher in edt1 mutants.

In addition, 35S::MIF1 seedlings underwent  constitutive photomorphogenesis in the dark, with root growth similar to that in the light. Furthermore,  35S::MIF1 seedlings were demonstrated to be non-responsive to gibberellin (GA) for cell elongation,  hypersensitive to the GA synthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol (PAC) and abscisic acid (ABA), and hyposensitive to  auxin, brassinosteroid and cytokinin, but normally responsive to ethylene.

When germinated on medium supplemented with paclobutrazol, germination rate was higher in double mutant seeds than in the single mutants or wild type, i.e., paclobutrazol resistance was enhanced in double mutant seeds. Dormancy was reduced in double mutants, and levels of ABA in the seeds were up to 18% lover than in the wild type or single mutants.	16412079
AT1G78390	atnced9-1	Seed germination in the dark after far red light treatment was almost completely suppressed as in the case of wild type.	17010113

AT1G78570	rol1-2	A detailed analysis of the rol1-2 mutants show aberrant cotyledon development with an uneven  surface and hyponastic growth, aberrant pavement cell and stomatal morphology in cotyledons, and defective trichome formation. Further the typical jigsaw puzzlelike cell shape of pavement cells was absent in rol1-2 mutants.	18567791
AT1G78570	rol1-2	No significant differences in the amounts of the major sugars of cell wall material, including Rha, were identified between the WT and rol1-2.  However, rol1-2 and lrx1 rol1-2 showed an approx 30% reduction in the RG II-specific monosaccharides 2-O-methyl-D-xylose and 2-O-methyl-L-fucose.

AT1G79580	smb-3; brn1-1; brn2-1	Root cap cells appear as a mass lacking uniform morphology. Cells can be highly elongated and twisted.   Cells fail to stop elongation and to  adopt the rigid, rectangular morphology of COL cells.   When compared with smb-3, the triple mutant has thesame number of complete LRC layers, and the appearance of the cells in those layers closely resembles that in smb-3. However, partial remains of older LRC layers remain attached to the meristem in the triple mutant, giving it a messy appearance. Remains of old LRC cap layers can be  found still attached to the root along its whole length.

AT2G02560	cand1-1	Similar to cand1-2 and cand1-3 mutants. Rosette leaves of mutants plants were much smaller than those of wild-type plants and had a wavy morphology. Mutants flowered later than wild-type plants, with an increased number of rosette leaves indicating that the vegetative to reproductive growth transition of the primary shoot apical meristem was affected. The growth of axillary meristems is also abnormal, where a large number of smaller leaves are produced.

Mutant plants continued to make new flowers while wild-type plants of the same age started to senesce. Other notable phenotypes of cand1 mutants include dwarfism and loss of apical dominance. When examined closely, dwarfism largely results from reduced stem elongation. Mutant plants had a strong increase in the number of secondary inflorescences, an indication that they have lost apical dominance.	15208391

The touch-dependent helical growth of roots is suppressed by the antimicrotubule drugs propyzamide and oryzalin, and right skewing is exacerbated by cold treatment.	15155883
AT2G03710	ap1 cal sep4	Flower meristems behave like inflorescence meristems and continuously elaborate new meristems, resulting in the 'cauliflower' phenotype. Eventually flowers resembling those of ap1 single mutants eventually appear and set seeds.	15530395

AT2G04270	CS318713	Segregates 3:1 WT:hoomozygous mutant. Homozygotes are white and arrest after the cotyledon stage. The phenotype is rescued by growth on sucrose.	18515828
AT2G04270	SALK_093546C	White seedlings that arrest at the cotyledon stage. Phenotype rescued by providing sucrose. On sucrose, mutant plants have small chloroplasts with fewer thylakoids and shorter granal stacks than WT. Fully developed chloroplasts are not observed.	18515828
AT2G04550	SALK_039359c	A higher proportion of the MPK12 protein isolated from ibr5-3 mutants is dually phosphorylated. The MPK12 protein isolated from ibr5-3 mutants also has higher activity than the MPK12 protein isolated from wild type plants.	19000167
AT2G05070	SALK_005614C	The mutant shows ABA insensitivity in stomatal movement, including promotion of stomatal closure and inhibition of stomatal opening. The detached leaves of the mutant lose more water than those of the wild-type plants under dehydration condition; both young seedlings and mature plants of the mutant have lower capacity to conserve water during drought stress in comparison with wild-type plants. The ROS levels increase in the mutant in comparison with wild-type plants in both the whole leaves and in guard cells. Treatment with low concentrations of ABA reduces ROS levels in both whole leaves(1 to 10 uM ABA application) and in guard cells(5 uM ABA application) in the mutant plants.	22143917

	17627276

AT2G05210	pot1-1	The fate of telomeres in pot1 mutants was followed for several plant generations and it was found that telomere length in pot1-1 decreased progressively with each generation. The ever-shorter-telomere phenotype and sharp TRF banding profile were strikingly similar to the phenotype associated with tert mutants, which lose 200-500 bp of telomeric DNA per plant generation.	17627276
AT2G05210	pot1-1 ku70	The mutants failed to elongate their telomeres, and exhibited a heterogeneous profile of TRF products similar to that seen in ku70 tert.	17627276

AT2G06510	Atrpa1a / Atmlh3	This double mutant has a lower chiasma frequency than either single mutant, but more chiasma than Atrpa1a/Atmsh4 or Atmsh4.	19153602
AT2G06510	Atrpa1a / Atmsh4	This double mutant has even lower fertility and shorter siliques than atrpa1 mutants. These mutants have a residual chiasmata frequency and distribution comparable to msh4 mutants.	19153602
AT2G06510	GK-406D08 (HOMOZYGOUS)	Meiosis in pollen mother cells proceeds normally from early prophase I to the pachytene stage where full synapsis is observed, in the mutants. However, a reduced number of chiasmatas are detected in the mutants during chromosome condensation in late diplotene/diakinesis.Univalent chromosomes present at metaphase I cause mis-segregation at meiosis I and therefore, aneuploid tetrads are observed following meiosis II. There is no evidence of chromosome fragmentation in these mutants, suggesting that RPA1a is not required per se for the repair of double strand breaks during meiosis.	19153602
AT2G06510	SALK_017580C	According to one report, this T-DNA insertion causes lethality and the authors could not recover homozygous mutants from a heterozygous parent.	15978034
AT2G06510	SALK_017580C	The rpa1a mutant has normal vegetative growth, but lower levels of fertility. Siliques are shorter in rpa1a mutants than in wild type plants, and their mean seed set per silique is reduced by ~68%. Pollen viability is also reduced in the mutants. Meiosis in pollen mother cells proceeds normally from early prophase I to the pachytene stage where full synapsis is observed, in the mutants. However, a reduced number of chiasmatas are detected in the mutants during chromosome condensation in late diplotene/diakinesis.Univalent chromosomes present at metaphase I cause mis-segregation at meiosis I and therefore, aneuploid tetrads are observed following meiosis II. There is no evidence of chromosome fragmentation in these mutants, suggesting that RPA1a is not required per se for the repair of double strand breaks during meiosis. There are no major defects in axis formation or synaptonemal complex formation in these mutants, nor are the number of MSH4 foci altered. However, there is a reduced number of MLH1 and MLH3 foci, suggesting that more recombination intermediates are repaired as non-cross-overs	19153602

AT2G13560	nad-me1.1 / nad-me2.1	The nad-me1.1 / nad-me2.1 double mutant has no detectable NAD-dependent malic enzyme activity. However, it appears to grow and develop normally and to have normal photosynthetic parameters. However, the levels of several metabolites, including fructose, galactose, sucrose, 2-oxoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, citrate, and several amino acids are altered in these double mutants relative to wild type plants. The metabolites affected differ depending on whether the analyses are done at the end of the day or end of the night.	18223148

AT2G15290	cia5-2 tic20-I	Seedlings grown in artificial media supplemented with sucrose are able to produce a few irregularly shaped leaves, followed by an arrest in growth. The timing of growth arrest varies from one seedling to the next leading to a variety of sizes and morphologies.	16891400
AT2G15290	cia5-3	Cotyledons in young homozygous progeny were red, most likely because chlorophyll was low or absent, and anthocyanin pigments accumulated.	17337631
AT2G15290	cia5-3	Dwarfed and chlorotic mutant plants.	17337631
AT2G15290	cia5-3	In the mutant's homozygous progeny, mature rosette leaves were retarded in growth. Secondary and tertiary veins in mutant leaves were thicker than in the wild type, and their diameter was commensurate with that of the primary vein. The organization of leaf mesophyll into palisade and spongy parenchyma cells was lost, and the leaf surface was extremely curled. This deformation in the mutant leaf was already visible in  cotyledons. In addition, leaf cross sections revealed that mesophyll cells, in contrast with wild-type plants, do not contain fully differentiated chloroplasts.
	17337631

AT2G15290	cia5-3	Plastids of cotyledons, leaves, and shoot apices in the mutant plants were characterized by the presence of electron-dense phytoferritin aggregates. Those clusters were not found in any chloroplasts of wild-type plants.	17337631
AT2G15290	cia5-3	Roots were smaller than in wild-type plants.  However, no significant phenotype in roots of mutants maintained on sucrose-supplemented medium was observed.	17337631

AT2G15290	cia5-3	The majority of the slowly growing homozygous mutant progeny produced almost transparent rosette leaves; however, in approximately one-third of the plants, the leaves appeared white. This subpopulation of mutants was even smaller and did not produce inflorescences.	17337631
AT2G15290	cia5-3	The shoot apex and the very young emerging  leaves of homozygous progeny were pale green and their leaves turned chlorotic while growing. After 6 weeks on sucrose-containing agar, surviving mutant plants were able to produce an inflorescence; again, the young sepals of the flower were pale green and became white subsequently.	17337631
AT2G15290	cia5-3	The style and developing silique of the flower of the homozygous progeny were pale green, whereas leaves and stem accumulated anthocyanin pigments.	17337631

AT2G15820	otp51-2	Homozygous otp51-2 mutants can only survive in sucrose-supplemented in vitro cultures under low light conditions. The small developmentally delayed mutants are pale yellow under normal light conditions. otp51-2 mutants fail to splice intron 2 of the the ycf3 transcript encoded in the chloroplast genome. Because YCF3 is required for the proper assembly of photosystem I (PSI), These mutants have multiple defects related to photosynthesis. They have lower levels of total protein, thylakoid membrane protein, and chlorophyll than wild-type plants when both are grown hydroponically. Chlorophyll a/b ratios are elevated in otp51-2 mutants, several PSI and PSII proteins cannot be detected, chlorophyll fluorescence patterns are altered, and the quantum efficiency of PSII is reduced. otp51-2 mutants also have elevated levels of unspliced products from the trnK, trnL, trnV, trnG, clpP, trnI, trnA, and atpF genes.	18557832

AT2G17290	SALK_033392	ABA and Ca(2+) activation of slow-type anion channels and ABA activation of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channels were impaired in independent alleles of single and double cpk3cpk6 mutant guard cells. Furthermore, ABA- and Ca(2+)-induced stomatal closing were partially impaired in these cpk3cpk6 mutant alleles. However, rapid-type anion channel current activity was not affected, consistent with the partial stomatal closing response in double mutants via a proposed branched signaling network. Imposed Ca(2+) oscillation experiments revealed that Ca(2+)-reactive stomatal closure was reduced in CDPK double mutant plants. However, long-lasting Ca(2+)-programmed stomatal closure was not impaired.	17032064
AT2G17290	SALK_093308	ABA and Ca(2+) activation of slow-type anion channels and ABA activation of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channels were impaired in independent alleles of single and double cpk3cpk6 mutant guard cells. Furthermore, ABA- and Ca(2+)-induced stomatal closing were partially impaired in these cpk3cpk6 mutant alleles. However, rapid-type anion channel current activity was not affected, consistent with the partial stomatal closing response in double mutants via a proposed branched signaling network. Imposed Ca(2+) oscillation experiments revealed that Ca(2+)-reactive stomatal closure was reduced in CDPK double mutant plants. However, long-lasting Ca(2+)-programmed stomatal closure was not impaired.	17032064
AT2G17370	hmg2	The hmg2 mutant has about 15% lower sterol levels than wild type plants, but its sterol composition is normal. It also has about a 25% drop in triterpenoid levels compared to wild-type plants.	17917299
AT2G17420	ntra ntrb	Double mutant plants are viable but the pollen has reduced fitness, and they showed slowed plant growth, modified seed shape, and high accumulation of anthocyanins. Seedlings are not hypersensitive to oxidant stresses	17586656
AT2G17420	ntra ntrb rml1	ntra ntrb rml1 plants do not show any shoot and root  meristematic activity. Meristematic  activities of most ntra ntrb rml1 plants are rescued when  transferred to Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing  GSH. The germination rate of the ntra ntrb  rml1 seeds is also perturbed.

AT2G17520	SALK_018112	bZIP60 mRNA splicing is detectable in ire1a-2 (SALK_018112), whereas it is completely abolished in ire1a-2 (SALK_018112)/ire1b-1 (GABI_638B07) double mutant.	
AT2G17520	ire1a-2/ire1b-1	bZIP60 mRNA splicing is completely abolished in ire1a-2 (SALK_018112)/ire1b-1 (GABI_638B07) double mutant whereas it is still detectable in ire1a-2 and ire1b-1 single mutants. ire1a-2/ire1b-1 double mutant is much more sensitive to tunicamycin than wild-type and ire1a-2 and ire1b-1 single mutant plants.  Induction of a number of ER stress-inducible genes is much weaker in the ire1a-2/ire1b-1 double mutant than in the wild-type.

AT2G17790	zip3-1/zig-1	Reduced response to gravity but not as strong as zig-1 along. Zip3 suppresses zig-1 phenotype.	20086190
AT2G17950	trn2-23010 wus-1	Whereas carpels were completely absent in wus-1 flowers and only 1.6 stamens (compared to 6 in wild type) developed in the third floral whorl, all trn2-23010 wus-1 flowers developed 2 carpels, which in contrast to trn2-23010 single mutants were seldom open (33%) and more usually fused. Consistent with the increased number of stamens (4.2 on average) in the third floral whorl, the trn2 mutation may compensate for a premature consumption of stem cells in wus-1 flowers. In contrast, the number of sepals and petals in the outer perianth whorls in trn2-23010 wus-1 was closer in number to that of the trn2 mutant rather than to wus-1 single mutant flowers.

	17566111

AT2G18790	CS6217	The randomization of hypocotyl growth orientation observed in WT that is induced through FR as a result of repression of gravitropism through phyA is enhanced in the phyB mutant.	17566111
AT2G18790	phyB	Although a rapid decrease of ABA levels during the first 6h after red light treatment was observed as in wild type, ABA levels in mutant seeds treated with far red/red light were higher than those in wild type.	17010113

AT2G19560	eer5-1	eer5-1 mutant hypocotyls show hypersensitivity to ethylene, but the hypocotyls grow similarly to wild type hypocotyls when etyhlene signaling is blocked using silver nitrate. eer5-1 mutant roots are shorter than wild-type roots when neither are subjected to ethylene treatment, but eer5-1 roots do not show altered sensitivity to ethylene. Transcript levels for certain ethylene-responsive genes are aberrant in the eer5-1 mutant. For instance, AtEBP expression is lower in eer5-1 than in WT dark-grown seedlings. But, EBF1 and EBF2 transcript levels are not altered in the mutant. Dark-grown eer5-1 seedlings do not produce significantly more ethylene than WT seedlings. Although EER5 can interact with members of the signalosome, EIN3 protein accumulation is not changed in eer5-1 mutants. Adult eer5-1 mutant plants resemble WT Col-0 plants.	18429939

AT2G21170	Salk-022963	This mutant has no visible phenotypic abnormalities.	20097871
AT2G21170	pdtpi	This mutant is severely stunted in growth. The seeds germinate at a rate comparable to wild type seeds but they begin to show aberrant phenotypes 3 to 4 days post-germination. Their cotyledons are paler and their primary roots are shorter than in wild type seedlings. The mutants have fewer chloroplasts per cell and the chloroplast differentiation seems to be delayed. They have fewer starch granules in their stroma. These mutants grow like wild type seedlings under dark-grown conditions. Light-grown pdtpi mutant tissue has roughly 40% less triose phosphate isomerase activity than comparable wild-type tissue. pdtpi seedlings also have elevated levels of glycerol, glycerol-3-phosphate, and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and reduced levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The level of methylglyoxal (MG) is doubled in mutant seedlings. Total lipid content is slightly reduced, but there are notable differences between various lipid components (e.g. MGDG vs. DGDG). Overall the changes in composition indicate an enhancement of the eukaryotic galactolipid biosynthesis pathway and a decrease in the prokaryotic pathway variant. DHAP and MG accumulation in the mutant may be responsible for many of the aberrant phenotypes.	20097871
AT2G21410	vha-a2 vha-a3	No tonoplast V-ATPase activity. Severely reduced rosette size. pH shifted to pH 6.4 in double mutants from 5.9 in WT. Reduced leaf growth under short- and long-day conditions is accompanied by varying  degrees of leaf tip and flower necrosis. Calcium content in leaf extracts of vha-a2 vha-a3 plants grown in soil under LD conditions was >2-fold lower than  in WT plants. In the presence of increasing  external concentrations of NaCl neither growth inhibition nor accumulation of sodium, potassium, and chloride was significantly different from WT.

AT2G21660	grp7-KO	grp7-KO (knock-out) mutants are less-sensitive to osmotic stress based on germination assays, and more sensitive to cold stress based on freezing tolerance analyses, than their wild type counterparts. These mutants also have altered stomatal responses. ABA-induced stomatal closure is decreased, cold-induced stomatal opening is increased, and NaCl and mannitol-induced stomatal closing is increased  in grp7-KO plants relative to wild type. There is no difference in stomatal closing in response to light.	18410480

AT2G21790	cls8-1	Homozygous cls8-1 plants had crinkled leaves that showed slight yellowing at 4C  (also apparent under normal growth conditions)  Germination and cotyledon development are indistinguishable from wild type (Columbia), however the first developing true leaves appear bleached. Subsequent leaves emerge curled and ?ruffled?, with bleached edges. The rosette leaves expand some become crinkled and show patches of white or pits on the surface. There is often a degree of asymmetry along the axis of the main vein, with one half of the leaf failing to fully expand. The bleaching is localized to the petiole and the base of the leaf, and extends along the edges of the leaf. As they continue to expand, the leaves become greener, although the crinkling remains. Following bolting, the  cauline leaves show similar characteristics to rosette leaves.  Flowers produced by cls8-1 plants can be asymmetrical and the petals crinkled in appearance. Siliques grow  to a normal size, but are slightly pale in colour with patches of white, and exhibit ?pits? like those present on the leaves.  Root growth is reduced in cls8-1 compared with wild type by approximately 20%.	17346262

AT2G22330	cyp79B2 cyp79B3 (AKF)	Subtle growth phenotypes under normal culture conditions: double mutant plants have slightly shorter petioles and smaller leaves, which would be expected if the double mutant produces less IAA.	12464638
AT2G22330	cyp79B2 cyp79B3 (SALK)	At 21°C, there was no significant difference between the double mutant and wild type; however, at 26°C, there was significantly less free IAA in cyp79B2 cyp79B3 relative to Col-0. In addition, the cyp79B3 mutant showed a modest decrease in free IAA compared with Col-0 at 26°C.	12464638
AT2G22330	cyp79B2 cyp79B3 (SALK)	Following <i>P. syringae</i> infection,  camalexin in the double mutant was undetectable. Similar results were observed following <i>A. brassicicola</i> infection.	17573535

AT2G22330	cyp79B2 cyp79B3 (SALK)	The hypocotyl length of the double mutant grown at 26°C was ~50% of the length of the wild type grown under the same conditions. This reduction in hypocotyl length likely correlates with decreased levels of endogenous-free IAA. Adult cyp79B2 cyp79B3 plants are also sensitive to temperature changes. cyp79B2 cyp79B3 grown at 19°C has much smaller, slightly curled leaves that are characteristic of known IAA-resistant mutants.

AT2G22540	agl24-2 svp-41	Under standard growing conditions (22°C), only the first three flowers of the double mutant were affected. These flowers had a reduced number of organs. In particular, this reduction concerned the second and third floral whorls that produced three petals and five stamens, whereas wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana flowers have four petals and six stamens. Furthermore, some flowers showed homeotic conversion of sepals into petaloid organs.
	16679456

AT2G22540	agl24-2 svp-41	When double mutant plants were grown at a higher temperature (>30°C), almost all flowers (90%) were severely affected in contrast with wild-type and single mutant plants that showed no floral phenotype. The double mutant flowers exhibited variable floral defects, and all produced a reduced number of organs.	16679456
AT2G22540	ap1-10 agl24-2 svp-41	The triple mutant displayed proliferating inflorescence meristems in positions that would normally be occupied by flowers. This phenotype is very similar to the ap1-1 cal-1 double mutant phenotype. However, the mutant formed a few flower meristems that produced  stamens and carpels. The triple mutant also showed increased levels of the FUL mRNA in the inflorescences  when compared with wild-type (five-fold) and the ap1-1 cal double mutant (two-fold).	18694458
AT2G22540	ap1-12 agl24-2 svp-41	Unlike the agl24-2 svp-41 double mutant, where severe phenotypes similar to the lug mutant were only observed when plants were grown at 30°C, in the ap1-12 agl24-2 svp-41 triple mutant, severe lug-type phenotypes were observed under normal growing conditions (22°C).

This becomes apparent at about two weeks after germination, except for the reduced root growth, which is already obvious at three days after germination. Moreover, unlike the ctr1 mutation that has a reduced transmission of the ctr1 allele relative to wild-type and infertile early flowers, the double mutants have a greatly reduced fertility but can readily be pollinated with wild-type pollen.	14675533
AT2G25490	ebf1-1 ebf2-1	When germinated in the dark, the mutant display a ctr1-like phenotype (short hypocotyls, short roots, and exaggerated apical hooks).	14675533
AT2G25490	ebf1-1 ebf2-1	When grown in the light, the double mutants display slightly longer hypocotyls, curled unexpanded cotyledons, and short and thicker roots with ectopic root hairs, similar to the ctr1 mutant. Moreover, the average area of the leaf epidermal cells was reduced 5-fold compared to wild type.	14675533
AT2G25490	ebf1-2	The mutants were indistinguishable from wild-type under normal growth conditions. However, when germinated in the dark, all three mutant alleles showed a slightly exaggerated response to ACC. Nevertheless, striking developmental alterations resembling those of the ctr1 mutants were observed.	14675533

However, in the fourth whorl, where trn2 loss-of-function interferes with the fusion of two carpels to the single style, double mutant flowers were comprised of multiple carpels, most of them fused (73%) as typically found in the clv3-2 mutation. Supernumerary stem cells in clv3-2 mutant floral meristems therefore not only led to the initiation of multiple carpels in the trn2 background but also favoured their fusion to a single style which remained severely twisted. In addition to a style consisting of multiple carpels, over-proliferating callus-type tissue was observed at the tip of the style in all flowers.

AT2G29630	thiC	A severe reduction (~10-fold) of THIC levels in plants decreases vitamin B1 (thiamin diphosphate (TPP)) levels and also leads to changes in the levels of numerous other metabolites since so many primary metabolic enzymes require a TPP co-factor. For example, alanine, asparagine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and malate levels rise while fumarate, gentiobiose, and ribose  levels decrease. thiC mutants are chlorotic and arrest in their development at the cotyledon stage.The mutant phenotype can be largely rescued by continuous supplementation with thiamin.	18332905

AT2G30410	kis-T1	Compared with wild-type trichomes, which normally are three-branched, the mutant has trichomes that are either two-branched or unbranched. Trichome stems and trichome branches are reduced in length, and the tips often are blunted.	12215519
AT2G30410	kis-T1	In leaf sections, mesophyll cells are frequently highly enlarged with one large nucleus. In some cases, the enlarged cells possesse incomplete cell walls and contain several nuclei.	12215519
AT2G30410	kis-T1	Male and female sterile. Male and female meiosis and/or early stages of gametophytic development are impaired. On the male side, the tetrad containing the four meiotic products seem to be normal initially, but before the release of the four microspores, nuclei appear to be fragmented. This phenotype is not fully penetrant. Approximately 5% of the released microspores are arrested at the binucleate stage, and 3% are arrested at the trinucleate stage, whereas the remaining microspores  have collapsed. A few microspores germinate  and form a pollen tube within the anther.  On the female side, ovule development started normally. However, at floral stage 12, when meiosis is completed in the wild type (Schneitz, 1995) and embryo sac development  has proceeded to the binucleate stage, the mutants still lack an embryo sac.	12215519

AT2G30580	drip1-1 drip 2-1	drip1-1 drip1-2 double mutants are developmentally delayed and bolt, flower, and set seed later than wild type plants. However, their overall size can exceed that of wild type plants if they receive adequate water. The transcript profile of these mutants differs from wild type under normal conditions, and in response to dehydration stress. Levels of numerous stress-inducible transcripts are increased in the double mutant. In addition, the double mutants appear to be more tolerant to dehydration stress than wild type plants, based on ion leakage assays and recovery after dehydration stress experiments.	18552202

Pin-like inflorescences are formed in mp, pid, and pin1 mutants and in wild-type plants treated with polar auxin transport inhibitors.	16227452
AT2G33860	sty1-1 ett-1	The gynoecial defects of ett-1 mutants, such as reduction in ovary size and increased gynophore elongation, were enhanced by the sty1-1 mutation. A number of double mutant gynoecia were nearly completely valveless, and in those, ovules grew on top of a placental surface. In addition, the apical ends of sty1-1 ett-1 gynoecia were less fused than those of ett-1 and sty1-1, and ovules frequently protruded at the apex. The amount of stylar and stigmatic tissues was reduced compared with ett-1, and the double mutant was sterile. As in ett-1 gynoecia, ectopic tissue of transmitting tract identity was generally present.	16740145

AT2G33880	stip-2	Hypomorphic allele identified as an intragenic supressor of stip-d activation tagged allele. Homozyous plants show about 80% seedling lethality. Other phenotypes include hyponastic cotyledon and reduced root size. Expression of WUS is reduced and the domain of STM (a marker of meristems)reduced.Heterozygotes have 25% abnormal embryos with smaller meristems. Phenotype can be rescued with the addition of sucrose in the growth media.	15753038
AT2G33880	stip-d	Activation tagged allele of STIP. Ectopic/overexpression of homeobox gene results in abnormal leaf shape, loss of apcial dominance, and reduced fertility due to abnormal ovule and flower development.	15753038

Analysis of cell wall polysaccharides isolated from mutant leaves and stems showed that arabinose content was reduced to about 75% and 46%, respectively, of wild-type levels. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated a specific decrease in arabinan with no change in other pectic domains or in glycoproteins. Radial cell expansion of the stem tissue was increased in mutant plants, but the cellular structure of the stem was also not altered. No other visible phenotypic changes were detected in the mutant plants.	16377743
AT2G35160	suvh5-1	The suvh5 single mutant has no obvious morphological defects or changes in histone or DNA methylation patterning, due to redundancy with suvh4 and suvh6.

AT2G40100	SALK_032779C	The mutant shows ABA insensitivity in stomatal movement, including promotion of stomatal closure and inhibition of stomatal opening. The detached leaves of the mutant lose more water than those of the wild-type plants under dehydration condition; both young seedlings and mature plants of the mutant have lower capacity to conserve water during drought stress in comparison with wild-type plants. The ROS levels increase in the mutant in comparison with wild-type plants in both the whole leaves and in guard cells. Treatment with low concentrations of ABA reduces ROS levels in both whole leaves(1 to 10 uM ABA application) and in guard cells(5 uM ABA application) in the mutant plants.	22143917

AT2G40190	lew3	leaf-wilting; when grown at 21-22C, mutant plants are smaller, have shorter siliques and are less fertile than the wild-type plants.  Growth phenotype is partially rescued at higher temperatures (25-26C); collapsed xylem with reduced cellulose content; more sensitive to osmotic stress and ABA.	19732381
AT2G40220	CS3837	Mutant root growth was already somewhat reduced compared to WT plants under normal growth conditions but was significantly less sensitive to inhibition by 25 mM trehalose. Root length was reduced only by 46% compared to 90% in WT plants (Fig. 1B). The  germination rates on trehalose were identical to those on medium without trehalose indicating that the smaller roots are not caused by delayed or deficient germination.
	17031512

AT2G40220	CS3837	The inhibition of root growth in WT plants by trehalose could be overcome by bypassing the need for starch breakdown through continuous light. Partial effects were observed with long day conditions (16 h/8 h light/dark regime). However, continuous light could not overcome the effects of trehalose on gene expression (AT1G10760, AT4G17090, AT5G16150), or starch accumulation in the cotyledons.	17031512

AT2G40850	SALK_022689	Anthers of plants homozygous for a T-DNA insertion in At2g40850 contained only a small number of pollen grains, and consequently, few seeds were produced per plant. Microscopic examination of the mutant anthers revealed that meiosis, the earliest step of pollen formation, was not affected. However, after tetrads had formed, the cells of the tapetum showed abnormally enlarged vacuoles. Later in development, pollen grains exhibited irregular shapes and, in mature anthers, most of them had collapsed.	17905860

AT2G41370	bop1-4 bop2-11 kan1-2 kan2-1	About nine-tenths of the mutants exhibited abaxialized vasculature. The exclusively adaxialized vasculature observed in kan1 kan2 petioles was not detected in bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 petioles. The radialized portion of bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 leaves showed various kinds of organ polarity defects. The vascular bundles of nearly half of the leaves (44.0%) consisted of phloem surrounded by xylem, while one-third (36.0%) displayed xylem surrounded by phloem, and a small percentage (16.0%) had a mixture of both types of vasculature.

AT2G42260	uvi4	Fresh weight of mutant plants was 2.1 times higher than that of the wild-type plants when grown under supplemental UV-B light. Mutant plants were less sensitive to UV-B light. In addition, the mutant plants have overbranching trichomes on their leaves and stems. Trichomes with more than five branches were often seen on mutant leaves, but were never found on the wild-type leaves.	16623893
AT2G42430	lbd16-1	Mutant plants appeared very similar to wild-type plants at both seedling and adult stages. Root growth was inhibited to almost the same extent in both wild-type and mutant seedlings in response to exogenous auxin. In addition, the lbd16-1 mutation did not affect auxin-regulated gene expression, because auxin-induced IAA5, IAA19, LBD29, and LBD33 to a similar degree in mutant and wild-type seedlings.	17259263
AT2G42430	lbd16-1	The number of lateral roots was reduced slightly in 7-d old  mutant seedlings compared to the wild type.

AT2G44750	AtTPK1/2-KO	These double knock-out mutants are thiamine auxotrophs that have a seedling lethal phenotype unless they are supplied with exogenous thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) through a spray-based application. In addition, these mutants have 2-fold higher levels of thiamine and 32-fold lower levels of TPP than wild type plants.	17611796
AT2G44750	SALK_011765C	The AtTPK2-KO single mutant does not have any obvious aberrant phenotypes, but, the AtTPK1-KO /AtTPK2-KO double mutant demonstrates that these enzymes are required to produce thiamine pyrophosphate from thiamine.	17611796

AT2G44950	hub1-1	Reduced leaf size and narrow laminae.	10353913
AT2G44950	hub1-1	The lamina area of mature first and second mutant leaves was reduced to 55% of that of the wild type. The length:width ratio was significantly increased, reflecting a much stronger reduction in width than in length of the blade. The mutation also affected rosette growth, reducing fresh and dry weight at flowering by 40 and 39%, respectively.
	17329565

AT2G44950	hub1-1	The mutant primary roots grew much more slowly than those of the wild type. No differences between mutant and WT were seen regarding cellular organization or cell wall formation in the root apical meristem. However, a clear reduction in meristem size was detected. The root growth rate of the mutant was severely reduced and no acceleration of growth took place. The average mature cortex cell length was significantly (P < 0.001) reduced from 171 &mu;m in WT to 104 &mu;m in hub1-1, whereas the cell production per hour had decreased by 65%, from 1.26 in Ler to 0.44 in hub1-1.	17329565
AT2G44950	hub1-1	The number of palisade cells across mutant lamina was 44% that of those in wild type, resulting in narrow leaf shape of the mutant. In addition to reduced cell numbers, distribution and size of the mesophyll cells were irregular with some enlarged cells and the air spaces were increased.	17329565
AT2G44950	hub1-1	The stomatal index was consistently reduced in all hub1-1 when compared with Ler samples, suggesting that a proportion of leaf epidermal cells of hub1-1 exit the mitotic cell cycle early. The stomatal index (i.e., the fraction of epidermal cells that are guard cells) increased more slowly in hub1-1 than in Ler between 5 and 8 DAS, with final values of 0.23 and 0.35 on average for hub1-1 and Ler, respectively. As a result, in mature leaves of hub1-1, fewer stomata were present, a difference that originated at the same time when division rates were changed.	17329565

AT2G46790	prr7-3prr9-1	double mutant shows dramatic and more than additive period lengthening in the light and becomes arrhythmic in constant darkness. Fails both to maintain an oscillation after entrainment to thermocycles and to reset its clock in response to cold pulses.	15705949
AT2G46830	cca1-1	In mutant plants transferred to constant light after entrainment in light:dark conditions (12 h of light:12 h of darkness), the period of Lhcb1*1 circadian oscillations was ~3 h shorter than that in wild-type plants grown under the same conditions. On the first day of the experiment, the timing of the increase of Lhcb1*1 RNA in cca1-1 plants was almost identical to that in wild-type plants. However, by the fourth day of the experiment, the Lhcb1*1 RNA peaked much earlier in cca1-1 than in wild-type plants.	10097183

AT2G47160	bor1-1	Requires a high level of B. When the B concentration in the medium was reduced to 3 microM, the expansion of rosette leaves was severely affected in bor1-1 but not in wild-type plants. In a medium containing 30 microM B the mutant grew normally but showed female sterility, whereas the wild type was able to set seeds. These defects of the bor1-1 mutant were not detected with supplementation of 100 microM B. In vivo concentrations of B in bor1-1 mutants were lower than those of the wild type, especially in the inflorescence stems.	9390427

Floral organ numbers are highly variable. Individual organs varied in size. Carpels failed to fuse resulting in severe reduction of fertility. In addition, plants display a highly unequal and distorted arrangement of flowers, both with respect to the angle formed by two consecutive flowers and their distance from each other along the axis of the stem.	17287247
AT2G47750	gh3.9-1	gh3.9-1 mutants had greater primary root length, increased sensitivity to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-mediated root growth inhibition, but no obvious effects on apical dominance or leaf morphology.	17216483
AT2G47990	swa1	Plants heterozygous for the swa1 mutation had shorter siliques, aborted ovules, and showed a semisterile phenotype. The mutation mainly impaired female gametogenesis and caused a minor defect during male gametogenesis. Confocal microscopy revealed that megagametophyte development was asynchronous in swa1, causing embryo sacs to arrest at two-, four-, or eight-nucleate stages within the same pistil. A small fraction of the swa1 embryo sacs were able to develop into functional female gametophytes. The swa1 mutation also showed a slight reduction in penetrance through the male gametophyte, although the pollen grains were morphologically normal.	15980260

AT3G01650	axr1-12 rglg1 rglg2	The triple mutant had an approximately additive phenotype. They were bushy and displayed the reduced fertility of axr1-12 plants.	17586653
AT3G01650	rglg1 rglg2	Although the overall growth of young rglg1 rglg2 seedlings closely resembled that of wild-type plants, the early rosette leaves were more elongated and darker. These early rosette leaves senesce after ~4 to 6 weeks of growth. The first emerging shoots were short and terminated by one or few flowers yielding fertile siliques. Later developing shoots were longer. Another difference between the wild type and the rglg1 rglg2 mutant was leaf shape and architecture. Mutant leaves were more oblong and often asymmetric and had reduced numbers of veins. Whereas leaf initials in the wild type formed a spiral, with an ~137.5° angle between leaf initials, the rglg1 rglg2 mutant formed two initials opposite to each other and then switched by 90° to form the next pair of opposing leaves. Thus, rglg1 rglg2 plants often had a decussate pattern of leaf mergence, instead of the spiral pattern of wild-type Arabidopsis. Additional phenotypes of aerial plant parts, in particular an increased cell size.

AT3G02130	rpk2-2	At the flowering stage, the flowers of the homozygous progeny showed normal floral structures consisting of the four floral organs: sepals, petals, stamens and carpels. However, the mutant flowers contained no dehiscent anthers, whereas wild-type flowers developed dehiscent anthers with dispersed pollen grains. The three-dimensional surface images revealed that the wild-type anthers at flowering stage were broken and many pollen grains released, while mutant anthers remained enlarged yet failed to dehisce.

AT3G02130	rpk2-2	Whereas development of the rpk2-2 anther locules proceeded normally until stage 4, inner secondary parietal cells directly differentiated into tapetum but did not give rise to the middle layer. Microspore mother cells in the rpk2-2 anthers underwent meiosis and formed tetrads between stages 5 and 7. However, subsequent development of microspores was inhibited and deformed microspores that partially aggregated were observed at stage 11.	17419837
AT3G02130	rpk2-2	Whereas the surface structure of wildtype pollen grains consisted of elliptical balls with three grooves and a striped exine pattern. By contrast, several rpk2-2 pollens showed deformed ellipses and a partially smooth surface, with most pollen grains highly aggregated together.

AT3G04680	clps3-1	Homozygous clps3-1 mutants cannot be generated. Reciprocal crosses using the gametes from a clps3-1 heterozygote indicate that wild-type and clps3-1 pollen are equally efficient in fertilizing wild type plants. But, there is roughly a 50% reduction in transmission of the clps3-1 mutant female gametophyte. No embryo development can be observed in a presumed homozygote indicating lethality at a very early stage after fertilization. Expression of 35S:CLPS3:TAP rescues the embryo lethality phenotype.	18971429

These double mutants also seem to be able to respond to vernalization signals and to gibberellin. But they have an impaired autonomous pathway to flowering. FLC transcripts are up-regulated in these double mutants through an unknown mechanism. The global level of asymmetric dimethylation of arginine 17 in histone 3 (H3)is reduced in these mutants. The transcript levels for several repressors of FLC do not seem to be altered in the double mutants, nor are there discernible changes in several types of H3 modifications at the FLC locus.	18660432

AT3G17360	pok1-1	No visible phenotype.	16682350
AT3G17360	pok1-1/pok2-1	At seedling stage pok1/pok2 double mutants differ from wild-type by having smaller cotyledons as well as shorter, wider roots and hypocotyls. Adult plants exhibit a dwarfed stature, but all organs are present, although miniaturized. Plants are fertile but produce reduced numbers of seeds. Microscopic observation revealed highly disordered root meristem cell patterns, with most walls lacking parallel or perpendicular alignment to the longitudinal axis of the root and most cells exhibiting irregular shapes. Examination of cell wall patterns suggested that misoriented cell divisions were largely responsible for the irregular cell patterns. In pok1/pok2 double mutant embryos, misplaced cell walls were observed as early as the octant stage of embryogenesis. Throughout embryogenesis, the mispositioning of cell walls continues, eventually giving rise to slightly misshapen mature embryos with a stubby appearance, compared to wild-type. However, incomplete cell walls and wall stubs, a common feature of cytokinesis-defective mutants, were not observed in Toluidine blue-stained sections of double mutant embryos.	16682350

AT3G24650	abi3-3	abi3-3 plants exhibited severe seed-specific developmental defects, namely reduced dormancy and severely reduced accumulation of seed reserve proteins. The embryos remained green throughout development and were desiccation intolerant. However, immature seeds were completely non-dormant and grow normally. The morphological development of abi3-3 embryos does not appear to differ from wild-type, and if imbibed 10 DAF the seeds germinate to produce normal looking plantlets. However, if the embryos are left to desiccate they do not germinate. It appears that AB13 gene product is not essential for morphogenetic development of the embryo, but is required for protection of the embryo prior to desiccation.	
AT3G24650	abi3-6	Impaired degreening during seed maturation - embryos were green throughout seed development and seeds are green at maturity and first true leaves were already formed at this stage. Embryo at maturity had fewer protein bodies, instead, large vacuoles were observed in cotyledons. Freshly harvested seeds germinated on wet filter paper within 2-3 days. Chloroplasts were observed in cotyledons of mutants seedlings grown in dark as well as in the true leaves. Seed phenotype of abi3-6 is indistinguishable from abi3-3 allele.	10634906

AT3G27060	tso2-1	At the seedling stage, tso2-1 mutants were similar to the wild type, with normal roots, cotyledons, and young leaves. Abnormalities first appeared in the fifth rosette leaf and persisted in all subsequent leaves, floral  organs, and siliques. The abnormalities included white sectors in green organs, uneven thickness, rough surfaces, and irregular margins of leaves or floral organs. Stamens occasionally exhibited carpel characteristics indicating homeotic transformation. The rough and uneven sepals apparently resulted from abnormally enlarged  cells as well as cell clusters projecting above the epidermis. The white sectors appeared to result from an absence of chloroplasts in patches of mesophyll cells and the formation of large air spaces or tiny cells in subepidermal cell layers. Occasionally, tso2 mutants exhibited  fasciated stems on which a single SAM, a group of self-renewing cells at the shoot tip, was enlarged and split into multiple SAMs. Finally, tso2 mutants exhibited reduced fertility, with ;29% aborted seeds. tso2-1 floral tissues were found to contain significantly reduced levels of all four dNTPs. tso2-1 exhibited slightly  increased sensitivity to UV-C light, but only at high UV-C light levels.	16399800

Oil bodies of ole2 ole3 double mutant are much larger than ole3. Treating ole2 ole3 seeds with freezing (at -30°C for 1 day) inhibits and delays their germination, although ole2 ole3 seeds without freezing germinate normally.	18485063
AT3G27670	rst1-1	Mutant plants showed alterations in the cuticular wax profiles and embryo development. Compared to wild type, the wax on inflorescence stems in mutants is reduced nearly 60% in total amount, has a proportional reduction in aldehydes and aldehyde metabolites, and has a proportional increase in acids, primary alcohols, and esters. Also, the C29 alkanes in mutants are nearly 6-fold lower, and the C30 primary alcohols are 4-fold higher compared to the wild type. In contrast to stems, the wax on mutant leaves increased roughly 43% in amount relative to the wild type, with the major increase occurring in the C31 and C33 alkanes. Approximately 70% of mutant seeds are shrunken and nonviable, with these being randomly distributed within both inflorescence and silique. Viable mutant seeds are slightly larger than those of wild type; the proportions of these fatty acids are not significantly different from wild type. Shrunken seeds contain 34% of the fatty acids of wild-type seeds, with proportionally more palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids, and less of the longer and more desaturated homologs. Histological analysis of aborted rst1 seeds revealed that embryo development terminates at the approximate heart-shaped stage, whereas viable rst1 and wild-type embryos develop similarly.	16183838

The lesions did not increase in size after appearance and were not bordered by chlorotic tissue. The frequency and severity of lesions varied between batches of plants, but lesion-free mutant plants were rare. Further examination of the lesions on leaves of the mutant plants revealed that high levels of starch were present in the living cells bordering each lesion at the end of the night, when the rest of the leaf had metabolized its starch. This starch accumulation occurred in a highly  cell-specific manner with adjacent starch-rich and starch-free cells.	15173560

AT3G42170	daysleeper	Seedlings homozygous for the T-DNA insertion completely lacked expression of DAYSLEEPER. Mutant seedlings grew very slowly, and showed no expansion of the cotyledons or development of normal leaves or floral organs. The root remained short and had an excess of abnormal root hairs. The main and lateral root meristems appeared to have a normal organization when young, but as they matured became increasingly disorganized. After prolonged growth on plates, a few seedlings (1%) produced some photosynthetic tissue.	16015335
AT3G42670	clsy1-3	Reduced silencing.	17526749
AT3G42670	clsy1-4	Reduced spreading of silencing, loss of endogenous 24 nt siRNAs.	17526749
AT3G43190	sus1 sus4	The activity of SUS was reduced to 10% of wild-type levels in leaves of the mutant, and was undetectable (reduced to less than 10% of wild-type levels) in roots. The activity of invertase was unaffected in roots of this mutant, but in leaves neutral invertase activity was elevated by about 40%.

AT3G43190	sus1 sus4	The double mutant line was much more  severely affected by flooding. After the 4 days of flooding, root weight had increased by only 44% (compared to 72% for wild type), and there was not statistically significant gain in root weight in the 3 days following flooding. At the end of the 7-day period, the flooding treatment had reduced the gain in root weight by  71% relative to unflooded control plants (compared to 33% for wild type).	17257168
AT3G43190	sus1 sus4	The sugar content of leaves was substantially higher than that of the wild-type control. This was most pronounced at the end of the night, when glucose and fructose were almost ninefold higher in mutant than wild-type leaves and sucrose was more than twofold higher.

AT3G44880	pao1	This mutant develops a lesion-mimic phenotype on the leaves similar to that of several acd1 mutants. The lesions occur in a development-related, light-dependent fashion, coinciding with the initiation of leaf senescence in the wild-type. Premature cell death was observed in the flowers. Sepals and petals started to degrade earlier than that of wild-type, resulting in flowers that fail to fully open. 40% of seeds aborts at an early stage of development.	16113212

AT3G47450	CS6511	sensitive to ozone (O3)	19054359
AT3G47450	rif1-1	rif1-1 mutants are pale green with delayed leaf development. They have a strong resistance to fosmidomycin (FSM), an inhibitor of the isoprenoid biosynthetic enzyme DXR. The reduced rate of degradation of DXS and DXR in rif1-1 mutants leads to a higher accumulation of these two MEP biosynthetic enzymes. Though RIF1 was originally believed to be an NO-synthase, treatment with an NO donor, does not rescue the DXR over-accumulation phenotype, implying that this is not an NO-dependent phenotype. There is a reduction in the level of the large subunit of Rubisco, and two other plastid-encoded proteins in the rif1-1 mutant, however, levels of the plastid-encoded ClpP1 protease are elevated in rif1-1 mutants, compared to wild type seedlings. A plastid-targeted YqeH-GFP construct can rescue the growth, pigmentation, and FSM-resistance phenotypes of rif1-1. YqeH is a GTPase implicated in ribosomal biogenesis in bacteria.	18469163

AT3G48160	del1-1	Epidermal cells on abaxial surface have increased DNA content.	18787127
AT3G48190	atm / tert	During five generations of growth, both tert and atm/tert lose about 500 bp of chromosome length per generation. But, whereas tert mutants show no visible growth defects through the G6 generation, atm/tert mutants in G5 show severe growth defects, such as aberrant leaf shape, delayed flowering, a loss of apical dominance, and reduced fertility. atm/tert mutants in G5 have a much higher rate of bridged chromosomes than G5 tert mutants.	16166376
AT3G48190	atm / tert	atm tert mutants undergo Telomere Rapid Deletion (TRD) events, that can lead to the production of a chromosome with a very short telomere. Just one of these structures can  prompt end-to-end chromosomal fusion events in the G5 generation. The anaphase bridges apparent in these atm/tert mutants seem to involve only a single chromosome in each distinct mutant line, and seem to occur between sister chromatids. These plants exhibit the same overall level of aneuploidy in the G5 generation as tert mutants do in the G6 generation (~52% of cells showing abnormal centromeric signals in interphase). atm/tert mutants are not as likely to undergo ALT (alternative lengthening of telomeres, a telomerase-independent process) as tert mutants, implicating ATM in this process.	17989233

AT3G48430	SALK_001018C	ref6-1 mutant seedlings do not have any obvious aberrant phenotypes under light-grown conditions, but they do have a late flowering phenotype. Adult plants have reduced cell elongation, manifested in a ~30% reduction in leaf petiole length as well as shorter leaf blades, but their leaf width is similar to wild-type. The transcript levels of some BR-regulated genes are reduced in ref6-1 mutants. H3K9me3 levels are elevated immediately upstream of the BR-responsive TCH4 gene in ref6-1 mutants.	18467490
AT3G48430	SALK_001018C	ref6-1 mutants flower later than wild-type plants under long- and short-day conditions even though they have the same leaf initiation rate as wild-type plants. FLC mRNA levels are increased in ref6-1 mutants.	15377760

AT3G48750	SALK_106809	Homozygous are lethal. In self-fertilized heterozygous, severe seed defects were observed  in the mature siliques, whereas no obvious defect was observed before the reproductive stage. The mature siliques contain normal and  aborted seeds at a 1:1 ratio.  Male gametophytic lethal. Microspores normally undergo an  asymmetric cell division, pollen mitosis I (PMI), to produce bicellular pollen grains. The larger vegetative cell  does not divide, but the smaller generative cell undergoes mitosis, PMII, to form the two sperm cells, thereby  generating tricellular pollen grains. Embryo is arrested at the  globular stage, most likely because of loss of endosperm development, whereas it is arrested at the one- or  two-cell stage in presumptive homozygous plants	16460514

AT3G48780	Atlcb2a-1 Atlcb2b-1	Double mutant is male gametophytic lethal due to defects in pollen development. Phenotype of the double mutant pollens became apparent in the bicellular stage. The cytoplasm was less dense and plastids were dilated and lacked oil droplets. The nuclear envelope structure was modified by the formation of vesicles between the inner and outer membranes. The microspores lacked the intine layer, and consequently lacked clearly defined ER and Golgi.	18208516
AT3G49170	CS16045	Embryos consistently initiated cotyledons and continued growth and cell division beyond heart stage.  Embryos consistently failed to elongate, developing instead as v-shaped embryos with wide,stunted cotyledons and no hypocotyl.	15647901
AT3G49240	CS16034	Embryo fails to develop beyond the globular stage.

AT3G52450	pub22-1 pub23-2 pub24-1	This triple mutant does not exhibit any obvious constitutive defense signaling phenotypes and it has normal fertility compared to wild-type plants. However, it has an enhanced relative oxidative burst compared to wild type plants in response to flg22, chitin, and the conserved elf18 epitope from a bacterial transcription factor. MPK3 transcripts remain elevated for longer in the mutant than in wild-type seedlings, though the MPK3 protein does not appear to have altered protein stability in this triple mutant.When challenged with the bacterial pathogen Pst, the triple mutant allows ~30 times less bacterial growth than wild-type plants. It is also less susceptible to a biotrophic oomycete.	18771922

AT3G53020	CS11180	Defects in apical-basal gynoecium patterning (similar to ett and mp mutants). Mutant plant gynoecia had shorter ovaries and longer gynophores than the wild type, but the total length of the gynoecium is normal before pollination. After pollination, the gynoecium of failed to elongate, resulting in shorter siliques which contained arrested seeds, resulting in lower fertility. The stv1-1 ovules had shorter integuments than wild-type ones, and in some extreme cases, the gametophyte was protruding from the integuments. Mutant plants had defects in vascular system and embryo organization, which are also associated with auxin signaling. Most cotyledons in mutant plants had abnormal vascular patterns that were asymmetric and/or disconnected. Cotyledons were occasionally fused or single, indicating that stv1-1 is associated with defects in embryo patterning. Growth was retarded in both aerial and underground parts of stv1-1 mutants, resulting in plants that were smaller overall than the wild type. In stv1-1 roots, growth rates were reduced, while leaves were smaller than wild-type ones and pointed. These phenotypic observations suggested that STV1 had pleiotropic effects on whole-plant development in addition to specific effects on organs and tissues affected by known auxin signaling mutations.	16227452

Reduction of 95% and 60% for neoxanthin and violaxanthin compared to wildtype. Zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin totally absent.  &#946;-Carotene-derived xanthophylls (violaxanthin + zeaxanthin + antheraxanthin + neoxanthin) only account for 5% of total carotenoids compared to 25 to 30% in wildtype. Lutein content is unchanged in the triple mutant compared to lut1 b1 and lut1 b2 double mutants, but zeinoxanthin has more than doubled compared to any of the lut1 genotypes.	12782726

AT3G54320	wri1-1	The wri1 has seed-specific phenotype, characterized by the wrinkledness of the seed and a strong reduction in the accumulation of seed oil. No striking differences between the wild-type and mutant plants were observed, in particular with respect to the number of siliques or seeds, a factor that could affect seed filling. Furthermore, the number of siliques per plant as well as the number of seeds per silique were not altered in the wri1 mutants. Early morphogenesis of the embryo as observed by light microscopy was indistinguishable in the mutants and the wild type, however, during the seed-filling stage triacylglycerols accumulated at a much lower rate in the mutant, and the final amount of triacylglycerols in mature wri1 mutant seeds was reduced by approximately 80%. The fatty acid composition of triacylglycerols extracted from mature wild-type and homozygous wri1 mutant seeds were different. There were only subtle differences in the time courses of protein accumulation during seed development between the mutants and the wild type. It appears that young mutant seeds contain more protein, whereas mature mutant seeds contain slightly less than wild-type seeds. Furthermore, the amounts of soluble sugars, including Suc, Glc, and Fru, were elevated throughout development of wri1 mutant seeds. Mature mutant seeds contained approximately twice as much Suc. However, developing homozygous wri1 seeds were impaired in the incorporation of sucrose and glucose into triacylglycerols; pyruvate and acetate were incorporated at an increased rate. Because the activities of several glycolytic enzymes, in particular hexokinase and pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase, are reduced in developing homozygous wri1 seeds, it is suggested that WRI1is involved in the developmental regulation of carbohydrate metabolism during seed filling.	9733529

AT3G57130	bop1-4 bop2-11 kan1-2 kan2-1	About nine-tenths of the mutants exhibited abaxialized vasculature. The exclusively adaxialized vasculature observed in kan1 kan2 petioles was not detected in bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 petioles. The radialized portion of bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 leaves showed various kinds of organ polarity defects. The vascular bundles of nearly half of the leaves (44.0%) consisted of phloem surrounded by xylem, while one-third (36.0%) displayed xylem surrounded by phloem, and a small percentage (16.0%) had a mixture of both types of vasculature.
	17601823

AT3G57130	bop1-4 bop2-11 kan1-2 kan2-1	Quadruple mutant plants developed narrow leaves with ectopic blade outgrowth along the petioles, like bop1 bop2 leaves, as well as ectopic outgrowths on their abaxial lamina, like kan1 kan2 leaves. However, all of the bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 leaves also showed extended, radialized petiole development that was not observed in either parental genotype.

AT3G57670	ntt-1	In wildtype, 62% of the seeds were found in the bottom half of the silique (50-100 percentile) and 5% were found in the apical region (0-20 percentile). On average, seeds formed toward the center of the silique (50?60 percentile). No preference was observed for fertilization of the  most apical ovules. In the ntt mutant, most seed formed in the upper half of the carpel (90%).	17600712
AT3G57670	ntt-1	Only female reproductive tissue is affected in the mutant, as shown by the fact that mutant pollen produces a normal seed set when applied to wild-type flowers.

AT3G60830	arp7-1	All the heterozygous mutant plants were morphologically similar to wildtype  plants under normal growth conditions. Mutant siliques revealed abortion of a significant number of seeds (25%). Seeds were small, white, or brown and shriveled. Those abnormal  seeds contained small, rudimentary embryos that were arrested early during development at torpedo and bent-cotyledon stages. The 25%  aborted homozygous embryos were rudimentary  and arrested at or before the torpedo stage of development. Despite aberrant embryo development, endosperm development, and enlargement of seeds,  harboring small mutant embryos appeared normal  until the late torpedo stage, after which the endosperm  and the integument layers started to disintegrate.  Eventually the seeds turned brownish and dried out prematurely.	16040647

It also has a reduced number of mitotic recombination events in a GUS-based assay. In addition, it has a greater proportion of homeologous recombination events than wild-type plants suggesting that MLH1 normally promotes homologous mitotic recombination but limits homeologous recombination.	17559505
AT4G10310	athtk1-3	athtk1-3 mutants have no obvious phenotypic abnormalities when grown in typical greenhouse conditions. But, across a range of different hydroponically-provided sodium concentrations, these mutants accumulate less sodium in their roots than wild type plants and more sodium in their leaves than wild type plants. Accordingly, the roots of these mutants are less sensitive to salt in root elongation assays, and the leaves are hypersensitive to salt in plant growth assays.	12417304

The ROS levels increase in the mutant in comparison with wild-type plants in both the whole leaves and in guard cells. Treatment with low concentrations of ABA reduces ROS levels in both whole leaves(1 to 10 uM ABA application) and in guard cells(5 uM ABA application) in the mutant plants.	22143917

Cells fail to stop elongation and to  adopt the rigid, rectangular morphology of COL cells.   When compared with smb-3, the triple mutant has thesame number of complete LRC layers, and the appearance of the cells in those layers closely resembles that in smb-3. However, partial remains of older LRC layers remain attached to the meristem in the triple mutant, giving it a messy appearance. Remains of old LRC cap layers can be  found still attached to the root along its whole length.

AT4G14220	SALK_042445C	The rhf1a mutant does not have any visibly aberrant phenotypes, but, an rhf1a rhf2a double mutant reveals the role of these two proteins in gametogenesis and proteolysis.	18552199
AT4G14220	rhf1a rhf2a	This double mutant has shorter siliques than WT plants, and lower fertility. Approximately 60% of ovules abort the megagametophytic development process at the FG1 stage. Often, one of the megaspores that is supposed to degenerate remains visible in the rhf1a rhf2a megagametophyte for a prolonged period of time. Some of the mutants arrested at the two nucleate (F2) stage, whereas about 30% developed normal female gametophytes that could be successfully fertilized to produce viable seed. The pollen of the double mutant is largely defective with about 50-70% nonviability compared to ~0.5% nonviability for wild type pollen. The pollen for rhf1a rhf2a mutants appears to develop normally through PMI, but 30-40% of the pollen grain fail to undergo this mitotic division, and then, of those that did pass through, another 20-30% never go through the next round of cell division (PMII). The variety of different ploidy levels measured in generative cells arrested at the PMII phase indicate that they could be blocked at the G1, S, or G2. Levels of myc:KRP6 increase in the double mutant, suggesting that this protein is a putative substrate of this E3 ubiquitin ligase. And many of the aberrant phenotypes observed in the double mutant can be improved when KRP6 levels are decreased by RNAi.	18552199

AT4G14713	SALK_057237c	Weak semidominant ppd silique phenotype, i.e., similar to deltappd mutant, and leaf curvature phenotype.	16916932
AT4G14713	deltappd	Mutant plants had larger leaf and cotyledon laminae, and leaves had a dome-shaped, positive Gaussian curvature, in contrast to flat WT leaves. Mutant siliques were shorter, flattened, and wider at the top and had undulations in the seedpod walls, compared with the smooth, narrow, cylindrical shape of WT siliques. Branching of trichomes on mutant leaves was reduced, to two rather than the three to four branches of WT. The larger lamina area observed in the leaves and cotyledons of mutant plants was due to increases in both length and width. For cotyledons, this increase in growth occurred without affecting shape or flatness. However, mature leaves in mutant plants were more oval in shape because of an altered lamina length-to-width ratio and could not be flattened without introducing cuts in the margin because of their positive curvature.	16916932

AT4G14850	loi1-1	loi1-1 mutants are less sensitive to inhibitors of the MEP and MVA pathways of isoprenoid biosynthesis than wild type plants. Lovastatin (an inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase and the MVA pathway), normally inhibits root, growth alters root tip morphology, halts lateral root development, causes cotyledon contraction, and arrests true leaf development. But, all of these phenotypes are less prominent in loi1-1 mutants treated with lovastatin. Sterol levels are reduced less in loi1-1 mutants than in wild-type plants following treatment with lovastatin. HMG1 and HMG2 transcript levels are not altered in loi1-1 mutants, however, there is increased HMG CoA reductase activity in loi1-1 mutants compared to wild type when the plants are treated with lovastatin. Clomazone (an inhibitor of DXS and the MEP pathway) normally causes albinoism and defects in thylakoid development in wild type plants, but loi1-1 mutants treated with the same concentration of clomazone can develop green leaves and normal chloroplasts. The transcript and protein levels for DXS are the same for wild-type and loi1-1 mutants.	17213228

AT4G16760	acx1-1	A sucrose-independent germination phenotype. Mutants have reduced medium- and long-chain Acyl-CoA enzyme activity. Lipid catabolism during germination and early post-germinative growth was unaltered in the acx1-1 mutant; seedling growth and establishment in the absence of an exogenous supply of sucrose was unaffected. Jasmonic acid accumulation was largely reduced upon wounding of mutant plants when compared to the wild type.	16146525
AT4G16760	acx1-1 acx2-1	Double mutant seedlings were unable to catabolize seed storage lipids and accumulated long-chain acyl-CoAs. The acx1-1 acx2-1 seedlings were also unable to establish photosynthetic competency in the absence of an exogenous carbon supply, a phenotype that is shared with a number of other Arabidopsis mutants disrupted in storage lipid breakdown. Germination frequency of the double mutant was significantly reduced compared with wild-type seeds. This was unaffected by the addition of exogenous sucrose, but was improved by dormancy-breaking treatments such as cold stratification and after-ripening.  Peroxisomes in the cotyledons were enlarged in double mutants, while in single mutants (acx1-1 and acx2-1) peroxisomes were identical to the wild type.	16146525
AT4G16760	acx1-3	Plants display decreased sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) on root elongation, while remaining sensitive to inhibitory concentrations of indole-3-acetic acid.  They maintain their ability to initiate lateral roots in response to IBA.	15743450

AT4G17380	Atmsh4	Normal vegetative growth and development, but moderate to severe reduction in fertility.  Meiosis defective, specifically the presence of numerous univalents at metaphase I and a marked reduction in chiasma frequency.  Early development of meiotic nuclei appears normal but synapsis of homologous chromosomes is delayed and may be incomplete.	15489296
AT4G17380	Atrpa1a / Atmsh4	This double mutant has even lower fertility and shorter siliques than atrpa1 mutants. These mutants have a residual chiasmata frequency and distribution comparable to msh4 mutants.	19153602

AT4G18480	aci5-3	Does not accumulate protoporphyrin IX in the presence of acifluorfen whilst wildtype accumulates up to three times more than in the absence of the herbicide.	15815918
AT4G18480	aci5-3	More than 80% of the mutants could grow in the presence of 500nM of the PPOX inhibitor, acifluorfen, while 50% and 100% of wildtype seedlings failed to grown on plates containing 50 and 100nM, respectively.	15815918
AT4G18480	aci5-3	The rate of 5-aminolevulinate (ALA) is one-third of that seen in wildtype, most likely reflecting feedback inhibition.	15815918
AT4G18480	aci5-3	When grown on soil or Kvitko medium, the homozygous line dies at the cotyledon stage. On medium supplemented with sucrose, the same mutant develops to the flowering stage.	15815918
AT4G18480	aci5-3_het	More than 80% of the mutants could grow in the presence of 500nM of the PPOX inhibitor, acifluorfen, while 50% and 100% of wildtype seedlings failed to grown on plates containing 50 and 100nM, respectively.	15815918

AT4G18750	dot4-1	dot4-1 mutants have an aberrant midgap leaf and cotyledon venation pattern and their roots are slightly shorter than wild type roots.	18643975
AT4G18770	SALK_020263	Specifically affects female gametophyte while overall morphology of the mutant plants was normal. The cell wall of synergid cells in mutant plants lacked extensive invaginations characteristic of the filiform apparatus. Instead, an extremely thickened cell wall was observed. In most cases, synergid cells lacked cell wall projections completely and had uniform electron density. Also, pollen tube guidance is affected in mutant female gametophytes. In wild-type pollen (and myb98 mutant pollen), pollen tubes grew from the placenta to the funiculus but failed to grow into the micropyle. Despite, fertilization is not affected in mutant plant, female gametophytes affected by the myb98-1 mutation can become fertilized and give rise to seeds. Thus, with the exception of pollen tube guidance, the synergid cells appear to function normally in myb98-1 female gametophytes.	16214903
AT4G18780	CS18	Does not exhibit any obvious increase in  its susceptibility to wilting.	9165747
AT4G18780	CS18	In general, mutant plants grow normally and do not exhibit any readily apparent alterations in morphology, except that they are slightly smaller than the wild type. In addition, mutant plants tend to grow slightly more slowly than do wild-type plants.	9165747
AT4G18780	CS18	With the exception of the collapsed xylem phenotype, both the organization of the vascular tissue and the organization of the entire stem of the three irx mutants are identical to that of the wild type. In addition to stems, the collapsed xylem phenotype of irx plants has been observed in mature hypocotyls and in the primary root and petioles.	9165747
AT4G18780	irx1-2	Phenotype not described.	11148295
AT4G18780	irx8 irx1	The homozygous double mutants progeny were severely dwarfed and sterile. The leaves were dark green, indicating an increase in chloroplasts per leaf area of the mutants, which was probably due to the reduced cell size. Several double mutant plants were unable to bolt and only grew rosette leaves.	17237350
AT4G18780	irx8 irx1	The homozygous mutant progeny are severely  deformed and are smaller in size compared with the wild type, possibly reflecting a reduction in water transporting ability.	17237350

Mutants are more resistant to drought and to osmotic stresss in both germination and growth.  Transcription of stress-inducible marker genes (RD29A, P5CS and ABA2) during non-stress  conditions is induced in mutant plants.	15998313

AT4G23650	SALK_022862	ABA and Ca(2+) activation of slow-type anion channels and ABA activation of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channels were impaired in independent alleles of single and double cpk3cpk6 mutant guard cells. Furthermore, ABA- and Ca(2+)-induced stomatal closing were partially impaired in these cpk3cpk6 mutant alleles. However, rapid-type anion channel current activity was not affected, consistent with the partial stomatal closing response in double mutants via a proposed branched signaling network. Imposed Ca(2+) oscillation experiments revealed that Ca(2+)-reactive stomatal closure was reduced in CDPK double mutant plants. However, long-lasting Ca(2+)-programmed stomatal closure was not impaired.	17032064

AT4G24540	agl24-2 svp-41	Frequently (70% of double mutant flowers) sepals were fused and they showed carpelloid features, including stigmatic papillae and multiple ovules developed along the margin of each organ.	16679456
AT4G24540	agl24-2 svp-41	The double mutant has the same flowering time as the svp single mutant.	16679456
AT4G24540	agl24-2 svp-41	Under standard growing conditions (22°C), only the first three flowers of the double mutant were affected. These flowers had a reduced number of organs. In particular, this reduction concerned the second and third floral whorls that produced three petals and five stamens, whereas wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana flowers have four petals and six stamens. Furthermore, some flowers showed homeotic conversion of sepals into petaloid organs.
	16679456

AT4G24540	agl24-2 svp-41	When double mutant plants were grown at a higher temperature (>30°C), almost all flowers (90%) were severely affected in contrast with wild-type and single mutant plants that showed no floral phenotype. The double mutant flowers exhibited variable floral defects, and all produced a reduced number of organs.	16679456
AT4G24540	ap1-10 agl24-2 svp-41	The triple mutant displayed proliferating inflorescence meristems in positions that would normally be occupied by flowers. This phenotype is very similar to the ap1-1 cal-1 double mutant phenotype. However, the mutant formed a few flower meristems that produced  stamens and carpels. The triple mutant also showed increased levels of the FUL mRNA in the inflorescences  when compared with wild-type (five-fold) and the ap1-1 cal double mutant (two-fold).	18694458
AT4G24540	ap1-12 agl24-2 svp-41	Unlike the agl24-2 svp-41 double mutant, where severe phenotypes similar to the lug mutant were only observed when plants were grown at 30°C, in the ap1-12 agl24-2 svp-41 triple mutant, severe lug-type phenotypes were observed under normal growing conditions (22°C).

AT4G24580	SALK_111625C	The ren1-3 pollen grains sometimes develop moderately bublous tubes, but they are fertile (unlike the sterile pollen grains caused by the more severe alleles ren1-1 and ren1-2).	19108776
AT4G24580	ren1-1	The sterile ren1-1 pollen grains from this heterozygous plant germinate precociously at a higher rate than wild type pollen tubes, and they often form bulbous tubes that are incapable of adhering to or entering the stigma. The domain of ROP1 expression in the pollen tubes is expanded in these mutants. GFP:RIC4, which binds to the PM-localized active form of ROP1, is also visible across an abnormally broad area in the pollen tube tips of ren1-1 mutants.	19108776
AT4G24580	ren1-2	The sterile ren1-2 mutant pollen grains from this heterozygous plant germinate precociously at a higher rate than wild type pollen tubes, and they often form non-functional bulbous tubes.	19108776

AT4G24670	wei8-1 tar1-1 tar2-1	These triple mutants do not make a primary root, they have an extremely reduced hypocotyl, and they lack discernible vasculature in their cotyledons. These mutants have a higher propensity to develop a single cotyledon than wild-type embryos.	18394997
AT4G24670	wei8-1 tar2-1	The roots of this mutant show almost no sensitivity to the ethylene precursor ACC, but sensitivity is largely restored by the addition of low levels of IAA (but not tryptophan). ACC-triggered dark-grown apical hook formation is also compromised in this mutant, and it is not restored by the addition of IAA. Root gravitropism is more disrupted in this double mutant than in either single mutant. The mutant plants are shorter than wild type, have reduced venation in their leaves, exhibit reduced apical dominance, and produce abnormal flowers. DR5:GUS expression is also diminished in these double mutants, consistent with a ~50% reduction in IAA levels in these mutants. Root meristematic cells differentiate in this mutant, leading to a loss of the stem cell niche and the cessation of root growth.	18394997
AT4G24670	wei8-1 tar2-2	ACC-triggered dark-grown apical hook formation is compromised in this mutant. Root meristematic cells differentiate in this mutant, leading to a loss of the stem cell niche and the cessation of root growth. This mutant also lacks valves in the gynoecia.	18394997
AT4G24730	atnrt3.2-1	When grown on plates containing 250 &#956;M NO3- as the sole source of available N for 10 days, mutant plants grew poorly, shoot growth being particularly affected.

AT4G25080	chlm	During silique maturation of heterozygous plants, some white seeds were visible, suggesting the absence of chlorophyll in the cotyledons of the homozygous seeds. However, after desiccation, the seed color heterogeneity was no longer visible.	17135235
AT4G25080	chlm	The homozygous progeny has an albino phenotype and does not produce seeds.	17135235
AT4G25080	chlm	When germinated on MS-agar containing 0.5% sucrose and under medium light (70 &mu;mol of photons m-2 s-1), the homozygous seedlings turned white and stopped growth after cotyledon development. However, when the plants were transferred after 5 days in medium light to dim light (5 &mu;mol of photons m-2 s-1), they could develop, although very slowly and with a stunted appearance; they then formed small yellow leaves.

AT4G25140	SM_3_29875	During walking stick stage, aberrant embryo cells contained unusually large oilbodies not observed in WT seeds. Large oilbodies in some cases had 5 micrometers in diameter. Changes in the size of oilbodies caused disruption of storage organelles, altering accumulation of lipids and proteins and causing delay in germination.	16877495
AT4G25140	SM_3_29875	ole1 seeds have much larger oil bodies than wild-type. OLE1 deficiency leads to loss of freezing tolerance of Arabidopsis seeds. Treating ole1 seeds with freezing (at -30°C for 1 day) inhibits and delays their germination, although ole1 seeds without freezing treatment germinate normally. Seed oil bodies of ole1 ole2 and ole1 ole3 double mutants are much larger than ole1 mutant. ole1 ole2 and ole1 ole3 seeds hardly germinate. ole1 ole2 and ole1 ole3 double mutants seeds do not germinate when treated with freezing condition (at -30°C for 1 day).	18485063

AT4G25530	CS106	Complete absence of cytosine methylation in two direct repeated sequences located in FWA 5' promoter and coding regions.  This is opposite to the strong methylation observed in wild-type FWA.  Hypomethylation activates expression of the gene and leads to late flowering.	11090618
AT4G25530	CS188	Complete absence of cytosine methylation in two direct repeated sequences located in FWA 5' promoter and coding regions.  This is opposite to the strong methylation observed in wild-type FWA.  Hypomethylation activates expression of the gene and leads to late flowering.	11090618

Reduction of 95% and 60% for neoxanthin and violaxanthin compared to wildtype. Zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin totally absent.  &#946;-Carotene-derived xanthophylls (violaxanthin + zeaxanthin + antheraxanthin + neoxanthin) only account for 5% of total carotenoids compared to 25 to 30% in wildtype. Lutein content is unchanged in the triple mutant compared to lut1 b1 and lut1 b2 double mutants, but zeinoxanthin has more than doubled compared to any of the lut1 genotypes.	12782726

AT4G29040	hlr-1	The hlr-1 (halted root-1) mutant has defective cell organization in the post-embryonic root and shoot apical meristems. Quiescent center cell identity in the root is lost after germination and expression of the organizing center marker WUSCHEL in the shoot is disrupted. However, cells in differentiated tissues maintain their normal identities. hlr-1 mutants have shorter roots, aberrant lateral root primordia positioning, abnormal leaf shape and phyllotaxy, and irregular shoot structure.	15073153
AT4G29040	hlr-2	The hlr-2 mutant is reported to share the same morphological characteristics with the hlr-1 mutant, but to have a slightly milder phenotype. hlr-1 has defects in root and shoot apical meristem organization, and root and shoot development.	15073153
AT4G29040	hlr-2	The rpt2a-2 mutant has modest defects in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis via the 26S proteasome, rendering it somewhat more sensitive to misfolded proteins that are degraded in a 26S-proteasome / Ub-dependent manner. However, it also has modestly increased levels of the 20S core particle of the proteasome, and exhibits some reduced sensitivity to oxidative stress, presumably since oxidatively damaged proteins can be degraded in a 20S proteasome-dependent, but 26S proteasome /Ub-independent manner.

AT4G29170	Atmnd1-delta1	Mutant plants had normal vegetative development, but flowers failed to produce pollen and seeds; no viable pollen was found in the anthers. In developing pollen mother cells, meiotic progression was interrupted at anaphase I, where chromosomes are randomly distributed and some appear fragmented. Normal embryo sac development was disrupted too, compared to the wild type. AtRAD51 gene was accumulated in the inflorescence nuclei of homozygous plants, while it was absent in the inflorescence nuclei in wild type plants. After exposure to gamma-rays, the levels of AtRAD51 was unchanged in the inflorescence nuclei in mutant plants, while in the wild type nuclei AtRAD51 expression was strongly induced. Compared to the wild type, mutant seedlings were hypersensitive to gamma-irradiation, had shorter roots and fewer leaves.	16442857

AT4G29860	tan-1	embryo and seedling defective. Mutant plants had defects in both embryo and seedling development. Mutant seeds accumulate anthocyanin, are intolerant to desiccation, cotyledons did not curl, and had often fused along one side of their margins. Trichomes were formed on the cotyledons during embryogenesis, and the accumulation of storage proteins and lipids were reduced. Tan mutants die as embryos, but immature mutant seeds can be germinated in culture. However, tan mutant seedlings are defective in shoot and root development with stunted roots and hypocotyls that fail to elongate in the dark. True leaves rarely emerged and plants die at seedling stage.	16113228
AT4G29860	tan-1 lec1-2	Most mutant embryos were arrested at transition or heart stage, with few reaching torpedo stage. Mutant seeds were desiccation intolerant and germinated poorly even when cultured on agar plates.	16113228

AT4G32551	lug-1 rbe-3	Additive phenotype. The number of second-whorl organs was reduced in lug-1 rbe-3 double mutants and these remaining organs were primarily staminoid. Thus, rbe-3 enhanced the second-whorl phenotype of lug-1 mutants. The double mutant rarely produced any seeds, suggesting a more severe defect in female fertility in the double mutant compared with either single mutant. However, no enhancement of the outer integument growth defect was observed.	16412084
AT4G32551	lug-16/luh-1	Double homozygote are difficult to recover and may die very early in embryogenesis. Plants that do form are reduced in size with mature plants as small as single leaves. The inflorescence bears few flowers consisting of only carpels.	18390806

AT4G32700	teb-1	A short-root phenotype with the phenotype in the aerial part that is similar to those of the tsk mutant. The roots in mutant seedlings were approximately one-third as long as those from wild type plants. This reduced growth became more pronounced at later time points. The root apical meristem was disorganized, and individual cell types, such as QC or initial cells, were difficult to discern. The aerial part of teb-1 plants also showed defects in morphology, such as abnormal phyllotaxy, highly serrated and asymmetric leaves and a fasciated stem. The cellular organization of the SAM was severely disturbed - L1 and L2 layers showed irregular cell division in mutant plants.	16517762
AT4G32700	teb-1	Embryonic phenotype: altered pattern of cell division became pronounced in mutant embryos at the early globular stage. Abnormal, transverse cell division of the hypophysis and extra rounds of division of the suspensor cells. In the heart stage, most of the teb-1 embryos showed an asymmetric and misshaped morphology as well as an aberrant cell division pattern, especially in the hypophysis descendents in the root pole.	16517762

AT4G32770	npq1 vte1	Molecules produced during oxidative stress (MDA) accumulate in vte1 npq1 leaves after 7 d in high light, confirming the occurrence of lipid peroxidation. Also, fatty acids and chlorophylls levels decrease in npq1 vte1 leaves.
	16258032

AT4G32770	npq1 vte1	PSII is strongly photoinhibited and lipid peroxidation is enhanced in the double mutant.
	16258032

AT4G32770	npq1 vte1	Very sensitive to high light stress. When exposed to high light at low temperature,most of the mature leaves of npq1 vte1 bleached in contrast with wild-type, npq1, or vte1 leaves, which did not exhibit visual symptoms of oxidative stress.	16258032
AT4G32770	vte1	In mutant leaves, PSII photoinhibition is more pronounced, and PSII recovery proceeded at a slower rate relative to wild-type leaves. Lipid peroxidation is not detected by TL measurements either in wild-type leaves or mutant leaves. Determination of chlorophyll, fatty acid, and MDA confirmed that tocopherol deficiency in mutant leaves does not increase oxidative stress during long-term exposure of plants to high light stress at low temperature.

The axillary buds, which are typically delayed in growth in wild-type plants, grow out to produce leaves and inflorescences.  The mutant plants have smaller rosette diameters due to a decrease in the lengths of petioles and leaf blades compared with wild-type plants.	16507088
AT4G32810	max4-5	The branching phenotype is more pronounced when plants are grown on short days owing to the nearly tenfold increase in inflorescence number in the mutant versus wild-type plants.	16507088

AT4G32980	ath1-1/pny-40126	Shoot apex arrests prematurely in less than 50% of double mutants. This occurs around 2 weeks post germination or after 8 or so sets of leaves are made. The meristems are reduced in size. After growth resumption new, abnormally shaped leaves are produced and the plants eventually flower.	19175771
AT4G32980	ath1-1/pny-40126/pnf-96116	In triple mutants the primary apical meristem terminates after germination-usually being consumed in the formation of a single terminal leaf. Growth can resume with the formation of new meristems however the phyllotaxy is abnormal.	19175771

AT4G33495	rpd1-1	Hypocotyl explants of the rpd1-1 mutant formed root-primordium-like structures after 16 days of culture at the restrictive temperature (28°C) on root-inducing medium, whereas at the permissive temperature (22°C), they formed normal adventitious roots. The inhibitory effect of the rpd1 mutations on adventitious root formation was detected at the primordial stage after six days of culture.	14522871
AT4G33495	rpd1-1	Temperature-sensitive mutant. Initial root primordium formation in the mutant hypocotyl explants proceeded normally at the restrictive temperature (28°C) on root-inducing medium; after three days of culture, the root primordium was arrested or strongly retarded at the two- to four-cell-layer stages. Therefore, the mutation inhibited the development of adventitious root primordia beyond the two-cell-layer stage without affecting the earlier processes of primordium development, including the initiation of cell proliferation. This developmental arrest was reversible upon temperature shift from 28°C to 22°C, root primordial developed normally and formed lateral roots. Mutant hypocotyl explants were cultured on callus-inducing medium at 22°C or 28°C. During the first four days of culture, callus growth appeared not to be affected in the mutant hypocotyls, compared with that in the wild-type explants. After day 4, however, callus growth in the mutant explants was retarded severely at 28°C.	16407439

AT4G36920	ap2-1 rbe-3	The enhancement of the second-whorl phenotypes in these double mutants resulted from AG misexpression.	16412084
AT4G36920	ap2-2 rbe3	In the double mutants, first-whorl carpels and staminoid carpels were often wider than in ap2-2. These organs had the appearance of several fused organs but were only connected to the base of the flower in the central part of the organ and were in a position normally occupied by a single organ. In addition, first-whorl organs were often fused along much of their length. All of the first-whorl organs were sometimes fused such that the fourth whorl carpel poked through a ring of tissue. Cells present along the margin of fusion resembled the epidermal cells normally present on the abaxial replum of wild-type carpels.
	16412084

AT4G36920	ap2-2 rbe3	The number of first whorl organs in the double mutant was slightly increased compared with ap2-2 single mutants. No second-whorl organs were present in the double mutant and the third and fourth whorls had an additive phenotype.	16412084

	16640459

AT4G37750	ant-4 rbe-3	Double mutants had an increased number of sepals compared with either single mutant. In early arising flowers as many as eight sepals were present. In addition, fusion between sepals was observed in ant-4 rbe-3 mutants. Sepals in the double mutant were often fused along their entire length rather than just at their base as usually seen in rbe-3.
	16412084

AT4G37750	ant-4 rbe-3	Mutant flowers also show a reduction in the overall number of second-whorl organs. In addition, fewer filaments and staminoid organs were present in the double mutant compared with rbe-3 single mutants. Reduced stamen number in the third whorl of ant-4 mutants was partially rescued by rbe-3.	16412084

AT4G38630	rpn10-1 (C24)	The rpn10-1 mutant has elevated levels of ubiquitin conjugates but the RPN(1-186):ARP(exon2):NPTII protein is still detected in a 26S proteasome-enriched fraction. This mutant has a reduced germination rate, several growth abnormalities, increased rosette leaf senescence, a reduction in stamen number, increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, decreased sensitivity to cytokinin, and increased sensitivity to abscisic acid, sucrose, and salt.	12671091
AT4G38630	rpn10-1 (Col)	The rpn10-1 mutant has defects in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis via the 26S proteasome, rendering it more sensitive to misfolded proteins that are degraded in a 26S-proteasome / Ub-dependent manner. However, it has increased levels of the 20S core particle of the proteasome, and exhibits reduced sensitivity to oxidative stress, presumably since oxidatively damaged proteins can be degraded in a 20S proteasome-dependent, but 26S proteasome /Ub-independent manner. The mutation confers the same phenotypes in Col that were described in the C24 background.	17971041
AT4G39080	vha-a2 vha-a3	No tonoplast V-ATPase activity. Severely reduced rosette size. pH shifted to pH 6.4 in double mutants from 5.9 in WT. Reduced leaf growth under short- and long-day conditions is accompanied by varying  degrees of leaf tip and flower necrosis. Calcium content in leaf extracts of vha-a2 vha-a3 plants grown in soil under LD conditions was >2-fold lower than  in WT plants. In the presence of increasing  external concentrations of NaCl neither growth inhibition nor accumulation of sodium, potassium, and chloride was significantly different from WT.

Yellowing leaves in the ggt1-2 mutant was caused by oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation levels increased
	17316175

AT4G39640	ggt1-1	This mutant plant has reduced levels of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) activity, with the magnitude of reduction differing between organs.

AT4G39640	ggt1-1 / ggt4-1 / oxp1-1	The 5-oxoproline (5OP) level in this mutant is not significantly different from the level in the oxp1-1 mutant, suggesting that neither GGT1 nor GGT4 are important upstream enzymes for generating the 5OP used by OXP1.	18768907
AT4G39640	ggt1-1 / oxp1-1	The 5-oxoproline (5OP) level in this mutant is not significantly different from the level in the oxp1-1 mutant, suggesting that GGT1 is not an important upstream enzyme for generating the 5OP used by OXP1.	18768907

AT4G39950	cyp79B2 (SALK)	Following <i>P. syringae</i> infection,  camalexin levels in cyp79B2 were approximately half of wild-type levels. Similar results were observed following <i>A. brassicicola</i> infection.	17573535
AT4G39950	cyp79B2 (SALK)	No visible phenotype.	12464638
AT4G39950	cyp79B2 cyp79B3 (AKF)	Subtle growth phenotypes under normal culture conditions: double mutant plants have slightly shorter petioles and smaller leaves, which would be expected if the double mutant produces less IAA.	12464638
AT4G39950	cyp79B2 cyp79B3 (SALK)	At 21°C, there was no significant difference between the double mutant and wild type; however, at 26°C, there was significantly less free IAA in cyp79B2 cyp79B3 relative to Col-0. In addition, the cyp79B3 mutant showed a modest decrease in free IAA compared with Col-0 at 26°C.	12464638

AT4G39950	cyp79B2 cyp79B3 (SALK)	The hypocotyl length of the double mutant grown at 26°C was ~50% of the length of the wild type grown under the same conditions. This reduction in hypocotyl length likely correlates with decreased levels of endogenous-free IAA. Adult cyp79B2 cyp79B3 plants are also sensitive to temperature changes. cyp79B2 cyp79B3 grown at 19°C has much smaller, slightly curled leaves that are characteristic of known IAA-resistant mutants.

The tubes can germinate normally in the presence of 100uM alanyl-ethionine (Ala-Eth), a toxic dipeptide, but they elongate more than wild type pollen tubes.  Root growth of ptr1-2 ptr5-1 mutants exceeds wild type root growth when Ala-Eth is present in the growth media.

AT5G01747	mir164abc	Plants appear normal during vegetative growth. Phenotypic alterations start after the switch to reproductive development. Flowers have an increased number of sepals and petals. Floral organ numbers are highly variable. Individual organs varied in size. Carpels failed to fuse resulting in severe reduction of fertility. In addition, plants display a highly unequal and distorted arrangement of flowers, both with respect to the angle formed by two consecutive flowers and their distance from each other along the axis of the stem.	17287247

AT5G02030	ath1-1/pny-40126	Shoot apex arrests prematurely in less than 50% of double mutants. This occurs around 2 weeks post germination or after 8 or so sets of leaves are made. The meristems are reduced in size. After growth resumption new, abnormally shaped leaves are produced and the plants eventually flower.	19175771
AT5G02030	ath1-1/pny-40126/pnf-96116	In triple mutants the primary apical meristem terminates after germination-usually being consumed in the formation of a single terminal leaf. Growth can resume with the formation of new meristems however the phyllotaxy is abnormal.	19175771

AT5G02030	rpl-2	The paraclades had a highly penetrant defect that affected the first one or two internodes. These internodes were dramatically reduced in length, giving the appearance of leaves initiating in the axils of the cauline leaves. The internodes on the main stem between the paraclades also often were reduced in size.	12897247
AT5G02030	rpl-2	The pedicels of flowers in pny were slightly shorter than those found in the wild type. Finally, flowers occasionally were aberrant, producing small, curved, club-shaped siliques at a low penetrance	12897247
AT5G02030	rpl-2	Vegetative development appeared normal in pny plants.
	12897247

AT5G02030	rpl-2	Whereas the internode length was relatively constant in wild-type plants, whereas close examination of the inflorescence in pny showed that internodes between the siliques often were absent or reduced severely. This internode defect appears to be random, because normal-sized internodes were interspersed along the stem. Clusters of siliques often were visible on the  inflorescences stems, indicating that the internode defect could span a large region of the shoot.

AT5G02190	pcs1	Around one-third of the ovules from pcs1/+ plants showed abnormal morphology at the stage of flower opening which then turned brown and degenerated a few days post-pollination. Around 10 to 15% of developing seeds from a self-pollinated pcs1/+ plant were homozygous for the mutant allele, and all pcs1/pcs1 seeds were aborted at early stages. In developing embryos, there was no obvious differences between wt and pcs1 embryos before the heart stage. At the torpedo stage, however, pcs1 embryos underwent degeneration. Degenerated cells were apoptotic, which indicates that the pcs1 mutation causes excessive cell death of embryonic tissues.	15723040

AT5G03150	SALK_054242C	jkd-4 mutants have slightly shorter roots than wild type seedlings, and about 15% of them show premature lateral root initiation. They have fewer root meristem cells than wild type seedlings at 5 and 12 days post-germination. But, there is a higher number of cells in the endodermal and cortical layers of the root in jkd-4 mutants than in WT seedlings. A loss of expression of SCR in the QC can be detected in jkd-4 mutants at the early heart stage and torpedo stages of embryonic development. A GFP:SHR fusion protein, normally confined to the nuclei of QC cells, is present in the cytoplasm most QC cells in jkd-4 mutants. However, GFP:SHR is observed in the nuclei of ground tissue cells in jkd-4 mutants.	17785527

AT5G03280	ein2-5	In the presence of 150 mM NaCl, the leaves of ein2-5 plants started bleaching after 4 days of treatment. The leaf growth of the ein2-5 plants was dramatically inhibited by 400 mM mannitol although remained green, the wild-type plants, by contrast, stayed green and continued to grow.

AT5G03280	ein2-5	Increased number of lateral roots. Reduced acropetal auxin transport.	18363780
AT5G03280	ein2-5	Root growth inhibition by ABA on ein2-5 seedlings increased when the concentrations of ABA were elevated. At the ABA concentrations (0.1-0.25 &#956;M) which stimulate root growth of wild-type plants, root inhibition of the ein2-5  plants started to be observed, and the most profound inhibitory effect was observed at 0.25 &#956;M and higher concentrations of ABA.	17533512
AT5G03280	ein2-5	Roots of the ein2-5 mutant seedlings showed enhanced sensitivity, although to a lesser extent, to salt and mannitol compared with the wild-type seedlings over the same period. Roots of ein2-5 seedlings were longer than those of the wild type in the absence of salt and osmotic stress condition.
	17533512

AT5G03280	ein2-5	Seedling growth, including cotyledon greening and expansion, was more sensitive to osmotic stress conditions. Severe inhibition in seedling growth was observed when NaCl and mannitol concentrations were 150 mM and 400 mM or higher, respectively. The cotyledons of the germinated ein2-5 seedlings did not expand and were yellow in the presence of 150 mM NaCl and 400 mM mannitol by 10 days after stratification under light.

AT5G03280	ein2-5	Significantly increased susceptibility to the oomycete <i>Pythium irregulare</i>.	17513501
AT5G03280	ein2-5	The germination of mutant seeds was markedly  inhibited by both salt (NaCl) and osmotic stress (mannitol). The inhibition  of germination of the mutant was observed at as low a concentration as 50 mM NaCl, at which concentration the wild-type seeds hardly showed any inhibition in germination.  As the concentrations of NaCl in the media increased, the negative effect of the mutation became more evident. On the high salt medium (greater than or equal to 150 mM NaCl), germination of ein2-5 mutant seeds was inhibited to a greater extent than the wild-type seeds. Likewise, in the medium containing mannitol, the ein2-5 mutant seeds showed similar kinetics in germination. Within a four-day  period, ein2-5 seeds had more than a 30% reduction in germination in the presence of 500 mM mannitol.	17533512
AT5G03280	ein2-5	When the mutant was grown on increasing concentrations of ABA, cotyledon greening of ein2-5 seedlings was inhibited dramatically, and the inhibitory effects were increased in a dose-dependent manner. Reduction in percentage of cotyledons turning green of ein2-5 seedlings was more than 10% at as low as 0.1 &mu;M ABA. At 0.5 &mu;M ABA, only about 20% of ein2-5 germinated seedlings turned green while 100% of wild-type seedlings were green at 10 days in light. The root elongation of ein2-5 seedlings was also supersensitive to ABA.

AT5G03280	seo2	Compared with the parent ein2 and EIN3ox plants, etiolated EIN3ox ein2 seedlings exhibited an intermediate phenotype in terms of hypocotyl and root lengths. A reduced EIN3 protein levels were detected in EIN3ox ein2-5 progeny compared with that of EIN3ox parent plants. The EIN3ox ein2 and five seo seedlings were completely unresponsive to ethylene application, similar to ein2. In addition, treatment with ACC failed to enhance the accumulation of EIN3 protein in EIN3ox ein2-5. The expression levels of ERF1 and EBF2 were not further increased by ethylene in the EIN3ox ein2 plant. By contrast, ethylene application enhanced EIN3 protein accumulation and ERF1 and EBF2 gene expression in the EIN3ox plants.	20647342

AT5G05850	pirl1-2 pirl9-2	microspore lethal	20697737
AT5G06070	CS6395	Altered petal morphology. A wild-type flower has four petals of almost the same size and shape. A petal is flat from top to bottom, and the bottom part is narrow and greenish. In rbe-1, petals were deformed and their degree of morphological abnormality varied from a mild phenotype of a reduced blade at the top, an intermediate phenotype of spoon-shaped petals with a small blade and a short filamentous stalk at the base, to a severe phenotype of filaments only. In some cases, no petals or filaments were observed at the position of petal formation.
	14681191

AT5G06070	CS6395	The epidermal cells on the lower surface of the filaments of rbe-1 had an irregular ridged structure similar to that of the lower surface of the wild type, but the cells were flattened and elliptic. The position of the filamentous petals was normal; that is, they were formed in the second whorl at a position between the medial and lateral sepals. Furthermore, in the small or spoon-shaped petals of rbe-1, the epidermal cells had a ridged structure and were smaller . This suggests that the position and identity of the aberrant-shaped petals of rbe was not altered.
	14681191

AT5G06070	CS6396	Defective in petal development; petals are transformed to filamentous organs, or lost; ovules have shorter integuments than those of wild type, producing shorter siliques; reduced fertility; strong allele.	14681191
AT5G06070	CS6939	Defective in sepal, petal, and ovule development; flowers sometimes produce more than four sepals and exhibit fusion between adjacent sepals; petals are often reduced in size or altered  in appearance, petals often absent or replaced by staminoid organs and filaments; altered integument growth in ovules; reduced fertility.	16412084
AT5G06070	CS6939	During stage 3 of flower development, four sepal primordia are initiated in normal positions in rbe-3 mutants. However, early in stage 4 some rbe-3 sepal primordia have undergone extra growth along their margins and appear wider than normal. The tips of these primordia were sometimes not located in the middle of the primordia and the two sides of the primordia were not symmetrical. Continued uneven growth of these primordia became more pronounced during development. By stage 5, an organ that had presumably initiated as a single primordium now appeared as two fused primordia or two closely spaced and partially fused primordia.
	16412084

AT5G06070	CS6939	In rbe-3 flowers, second-whorl petals are often reduced in size or altered in appearance. Petals with staminoid characteristics, stamens, filaments or the absence of organs can all be found in the second whorl of rbe-3 mutants.	16412084
AT5G06070	CS6939	Mutant flowers sometimes produce more than four sepals and exhibit fusion between adjacent sepals. More than four sepals were observed in approximately 7% of rbe-3 flowers, while some degree of sepal fusion was observed in 35% of flowers (corresponding to 10% of all sepals). In rbe-3 flowers with more than four sepals, the extra sepal was thinner than the remaining four sepals. In some cases, one of the adjacent sepals was  also somewhat reduced in width. Sepal fusion can occur in the absence of more than four sepals. Sepal fusion was observed most often at the base of these organs and more rarely along their entire length. We measured the width of mature sepals to determine whether  sepal fusion might be due to wider organs. rbe-3 sepals were 12% wider than Landsberg erecta (Ler) sepals at maturity.	16412084
AT5G06070	ag-1 rbe-3	Same phenotype as ag-1 single mutants with completely normal petals developing in the second whorl. In addition, sepal number was normal in these flowers and no cases of sepal fusion were observed.	16412084
AT5G06070	ant-4 rbe-3	Double mutants had an increased number of sepals compared with either single mutant. In early arising flowers as many as eight sepals were present. In addition, fusion between sepals was observed in ant-4 rbe-3 mutants. Sepals in the double mutant were often fused along their entire length rather than just at their base as usually seen in rbe-3.
	16412084

AT5G06070	ant-4 rbe-3	Mutant flowers also show a reduction in the overall number of second-whorl organs. In addition, fewer filaments and staminoid organs were present in the double mutant compared with rbe-3 single mutants. Reduced stamen number in the third whorl of ant-4 mutants was partially rescued by rbe-3.	16412084
AT5G06070	ap2-1 rbe-3	Additive phenotype in the first and fourth whorls. Second-whorl organs of the double mutant were more completely converted to stamens or were missing entirely.
	16412084

AT5G06070	ap2-1 rbe-3	The enhancement of the second-whorl phenotypes in these double mutants resulted from AG misexpression.	16412084
AT5G06070	ap2-2 rbe3	In the double mutants, first-whorl carpels and staminoid carpels were often wider than in ap2-2. These organs had the appearance of several fused organs but were only connected to the base of the flower in the central part of the organ and were in a position normally occupied by a single organ. In addition, first-whorl organs were often fused along much of their length. All of the first-whorl organs were sometimes fused such that the fourth whorl carpel poked through a ring of tissue. Cells present along the margin of fusion resembled the epidermal cells normally present on the abaxial replum of wild-type carpels.
	16412084

AT5G06070	ap2-2 rbe3	The number of first whorl organs in the double mutant was slightly increased compared with ap2-2 single mutants. No second-whorl organs were present in the double mutant and the third and fourth whorls had an additive phenotype.	16412084
AT5G06070	clf-2 rbe-3	The enhancement of the second-whorl phenotypes in these double mutants resulted from AG misexpression.	16412084
AT5G06070	clf-2 rbe-3	leaf curling similar to that in clf-2. Both clf-2 and clf-2 rbe-3 produced an average of 4.0 second-whorl organs per flower. In clf-2 mutants these were almost exclusively small petals whereas the average number of small petals in clf-2 rbe-3 was 1.37. Second-whorl petals were most often replaced by spoonshaped petals, staminoid petals, petaloid stamens or stamens.
	16412084

AT5G06070	cuc2-1 rbe-3	Four distinct sepal primordia are initiated in a normal pattern during stage 3 of flower development as was seen previously for cuc2-1 and rbe-3 single mutants. Later growth of sepal primordia in the cuc2-1 rbe-3 double is uneven, similar to that seen in rbe-3 single mutants. An increased extent of sepal fusion in the cuc2-1 rbe-3 double mutant as compared with cuc2-1 was first observed during stage 6.	16412084
AT5G06070	cuc2-1 rbe-3	In double mutant flowers, sepal fusion occurred more often and to a greater extent than in either single mutant.
	16412084

AT5G06070	lug-1 rbe-3	Additive phenotype. The number of second-whorl organs was reduced in lug-1 rbe-3 double mutants and these remaining organs were primarily staminoid. Thus, rbe-3 enhanced the second-whorl phenotype of lug-1 mutants. The double mutant rarely produced any seeds, suggesting a more severe defect in female fertility in the double mutant compared with either single mutant. However, no enhancement of the outer integument growth defect was observed.	16412084
AT5G06070	ufo-11 rbe-3	Double-mutant flowers have a phenotype that is similar to ufo-11 flowers.	16412084
AT5G06070	ufo-2 rbe-3	Double mutant has the same phenotype as the ufo-2 single mutant. There is no increase in the number of filaments and/or staminoid organs in the double mutant as compared with ufo-2.	16412084

AT5G08020	SALK_088429C	This mutant does not differ visibly from a wild type plant when grown under normal conditions. A UV-B dose during the first week of growth on normal media affects the atrpa70b mutant and wild-type seedlings similarly, although the mutants have an increased level of leaf yellowing. After a longer period of exposure to UV-B, the level of chlorophyll A and B is reduced to a greater extent in rpa70b mutants than in wild-type, and root growth is more inhibited in the mutants. Treatment with MMS also causes a greater inhibition of root growth in rpa70b mutants than in wild-type seedlings. In contrast, the mutants show a wild-type level of sensitivity to H2O2 in root growth assays.	15978034

AT5G09750	hec1 hec3	Compared with wild type, stigmas were smaller and more variable in size in hec1 hec3 mutants. There was also a slight tendency for the style to be somewhat longer in the double mutant.	17855426
AT5G09750	hec1 hec3	Double mutant had a sizable reduction in overall fertility (17% wild-type seed set), along with significant variations in individual fruit size and seed yield. Seed distribution was biased toward the apical half of the carpel, but substantial fertilization also occurred in the basal half.	17855426
AT5G09750	hec1 hec3	Mutant carpels showed significantly fewer pollen tubes and pollination events, particularly in the basal half of the gynoecium.	17855426
AT5G09750	hec1 hec3	The double mutant, however, had dramatically reduced Alcian Blue staining in both the style and the septum compared with wild type. In analyzing pre-fertilization stages of development, the transmitting tract of the hec1 hec3 double mutant had no delay in onset of ECM production, but produced less ECM than wild type.	17855426

AT5G13960	CS6367	The kyp-2 mutant has defects in callus formation under laboratory conditions. Many fewer seeds form calluses compared to wild type seeds, and the calluses that do form are delayed and smaller in size. kyp-2 mutants are defective in the process known as alternative lengthening of telomeres, a telomerase-independent process. These mutants also show a loss of association between K9-dimethylated H3 histones and telomeric and centromeric DNA via ChIP assays.	17448460

AT5G14420	rglg1 rglg2	Although the overall growth of young rglg1 rglg2 seedlings closely resembled that of wild-type plants, the early rosette leaves were more elongated and darker. These early rosette leaves senesce after ~4 to 6 weeks of growth. The first emerging shoots were short and terminated by one or few flowers yielding fertile siliques. Later developing shoots were longer. Another difference between the wild type and the rglg1 rglg2 mutant was leaf shape and architecture. Mutant leaves were more oblong and often asymmetric and had reduced numbers of veins. Whereas leaf initials in the wild type formed a spiral, with an ~137.5° angle between leaf initials, the rglg1 rglg2 mutant formed two initials opposite to each other and then switched by 90° to form the next pair of opposing leaves. Thus, rglg1 rglg2 plants often had a decussate pattern of leaf mergence, instead of the spiral pattern of wild-type Arabidopsis. Additional phenotypes of aerial plant parts, in particular an increased cell size.

AT5G15800	sep1 sep2 se3/+ sep4	Many flowers display a loss of fourth whorl determinancy.	15530395
AT5G15800	sep1 sep2 se3/+ sep4	Profound changes in early arising flowers. Both organ numbers and organ identity are affected in a highly variable manner.	15530395
AT5G15800	sep1 sep2 se3/+ sep4	Stellate trichomes are frequently observed on carpels (never on wild-type).	15530395
AT5G15800	sep1 sep2 sep3	Adaxial epidermal cells have a slightly irregular edge, indicating a partial adoption of leaf fate.	15530395
AT5G15800	sep1 sep2 sep3	All flower organs resemble sepals. The second whorl has four green sepal-like organs (instead of four white petals) which are differentiated of interspersed stomata and the conversion of nearly all of the cells into sepal cells. Sepals replace stamens in the third whorl. The fourth whorl is a reiteration of whorls 1, 2 and 3.	10821278
AT5G15800	sep1 sep2 sep3 sep4	All flower organs are converted to leaf-like organs, most strikingly on their adaxial surface. Abaxial epidermal cells are made up of a mixture of leaf- and sepal-like characteristics. Leaf characteristics include an abundance of branched trichomes.	15530395
AT5G15800	sep1 sep2 sep3/+	Normal flowers apart from a reduction in the number of stamens.	15530395

AT5G16310	uch1-1 uch2-1	Accumulated less chlorophyll than wild-type.  Smaller and more compact rosettes than wild-type. More lanceolate cauline leaves.  Less fertile.  Under short day conditions, the double mutant develops a less branched primary inflorescence.	17559514
AT5G16530	pin5-5	Defective in lateral root initiation as well as in root and hypocotyl growth; root growth less sensitive to low concentrations of IAA.	19506555
AT5G16560	bop1-4 bop2-11 kan1-2 kan2-1	About nine-tenths of the mutants exhibited abaxialized vasculature. The exclusively adaxialized vasculature observed in kan1 kan2 petioles was not detected in bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 petioles. The radialized portion of bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 leaves showed various kinds of organ polarity defects. The vascular bundles of nearly half of the leaves (44.0%) consisted of phloem surrounded by xylem, while one-third (36.0%) displayed xylem surrounded by phloem, and a small percentage (16.0%) had a mixture of both types of vasculature.
	17601823

AT5G16560	bop1-4 bop2-11 kan1-2 kan2-1	Quadruple mutant plants developed narrow leaves with ectopic blade outgrowth along the petioles, like bop1 bop2 leaves, as well as ectopic outgrowths on their abaxial lamina, like kan1 kan2 leaves. However, all of the bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 leaves also showed extended, radialized petiole development that was not observed in either parental genotype.
	17601823

AT5G16560	bop1-4 bop2-11 kan1-2 kan2-1	bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 stems had a decreased ratio of adaxialized vascular phenotypes compared with kan1 kan2 stems. Similar to what was observed in petioles, 6.7% of bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 stems exhibited an abaxialized phenotype of xylem surrounded by phloem, while others (13.3%) had both types of vasculature in a single stem.	17601823
AT5G16560	crc-1 kan1-2	Ectopic adaxial tissues are restricted to the medial domain of the carpels, normally occupied by the abaxial replum.  Formation of external ovule-bearing placentae.	11525739
AT5G16560	kan1 kan2 ats	Similar to kan1 kan2 double mutant.  However, the ovules have a novel phenotype, forming a single amorphous structure in place of both integuments.	16623911
AT5G16560	kan1-2	A few external ovules develop at the base of the gynoecium and straps of ectopic style from along the abaxial replum. Phenotype is present primarily in the first formed carpels.	11525739
AT5G16560	kan1-2 kan2-1	All kan1 kan2 stem vascular bundles displayed phloem surrounded by xylem, indicating adaxialized polarity.	17601823
AT5G16560	kan1-2 kan2-1	Cotyledons are narrow, cup-shaped and point upward. Leaves are narrow, dark green and develop ectopic outgrowths on their abaxial side only.  Four to six stipules, rather than two, develop at the base of each leaf, surrounding its entire circumference.  Stems fail to elongate upon flowering.  Floral organ morphology is highly abnormal.  Mature ovules have reduced outer integuments. Aberrant positioning of cell types, primarily along the adaxial/abaxial lateral organ axis.	11525739
AT5G16560	kan1-2 kan2-1	Double mutant plants have narrow leaves and developed ectopic outgrowths on their abaxial lamina.
	17601823

AT5G16560	kan1-2 kan2-1	External structures of the carpel are largely absent.  Ovules arise from a surface or column of tissue at the center of the flower. The inner integuments of these ovules are normal but the asymmetrical outer integument is now a nearly symmetrical and relatively amorphous collar of tissue.	16623911
AT5G16560	kan1-2 kan2-1	The vasculature in more than half (55.9%) of kan1 kan2 leaf petioles exhibited a pattern of phloem surrounded by xylem, representing an adaxialized phenotype. However, very surprisingly, 17.6% of kan1 kan2 leaf petioles had abaxialized vasculature or a mixture of adaxialized and abaxialized vasculature.	17601823
AT5G16750	toz	Embryo proper is unable to execute regulated divisions in reference to the choice of division plane and the timeing of the division, particularly longitudinal divisions of the plane of the apical-basal axis.	17616738
AT5G16750	toz	Homozygotes are embryo lethal, due to the abortion of toz/toz seeds.  Transmission of the mutation is not affected through the pollen, only through the ovules.  Homozygote embryos also show abnormal expression of patterning genes such as STM, MP, FIL and ANT.	17616738
AT5G16780	dot2-1	dot2-1 mutants are dwarved plants that display an aberrant spurred leaf venation pattern and fail to flower. They also have an abnormal cotyledon number, shorter petioles, significantly shorter roots and smaller rosettes when compared to wild-type plants.	18643975
AT5G16850	SALK_041265C	AtTERT deficiency leads to telomere shortening and absence of telomerase activity.	21865176
AT5G16850	SALK_050921	AtTERT deficiency leads to telomere shortening and absence of telomerase activity.	21865176
AT5G16850	atm / tert	During five generations of growth, both tert and atm/tert lose about 500 bp of chromosome length per generation. But, whereas tert mutants show no visible growth defects through the G6 generation, atm/tert mutants in G5 show severe growth defects, such as aberrant leaf shape, delayed flowering, a loss of apical dominance, and reduced fertility. atm/tert mutants in G5 have a much higher rate of bridged chromosomes than G5 tert mutants.	16166376
AT5G16850	atm / tert	atm tert mutants undergo Telomere Rapid Deletion (TRD) events, that can lead to the production of a chromosome with a very short telomere. Just one of these structures can  prompt end-to-end chromosomal fusion events in the G5 generation. The anaphase bridges apparent in these atm/tert mutants seem to involve only a single chromosome in each distinct mutant line, and seem to occur between sister chromatids. These plants exhibit the same overall level of aneuploidy in the G5 generation as tert mutants do in the G6 generation (~52% of cells showing abnormal centromeric signals in interphase). atm/tert mutants are not as likely to undergo ALT (alternative lengthening of telomeres, a telomerase-independent process) as tert mutants, implicating ATM in this process.	17989233
AT5G16850	atr / tert	atr/tert mutants show a more rapid loss of telomeric length than tert and atm/tert mutants, and show a more rapid degeneration in growth habit, becoming small, with aberrant leaf shape, and very low fertility by the third generation whereas tert mutants and tert/atm mutants show normal growth features until later generations. These mutants also have marked defects in chromosomal organization by G3 as evidenced by the presence of anaphase bridges, sometimes involving multiple chromosomes, a phenotype not seen in tert or atm/tert mutants.	16166376
AT5G16850	ku70 tert	In contrast to the ku70 mutant, which undergo telomerase-dependent expansion to more than twice the normal length in a single generation, the ku70 tert double mutant displays accelerated telomere shortening and a precocious onset of genome stability.
	17627276

AT5G16850	pot1-1 ku70 tert	Same degree of telomere shortening as in the pot1 ku70 and ku70 tert double mutants.	17627276
AT5G16850	pot1-1 tert	Telomeres in the double mutants shortened at the same rate as in either single mutant.
	17627276

AT5G16850	pot1-1 tert	Telomeres of the same length and sharp banding profile were found in the double mutant, as in their tert and pot1-1 siblings.	17627276
AT5G16850	tert	50% of the mitotic nuclei in anaphase from tert mutants with severe growth defects (in the G8 generation) have anaphase bridges, while none are found in comparable wild type controls. These anaphase bridges occur disproportionately often between rDNA regions. A number of chromosomal defects can also be visualized during metaphase in these mutants. About 30% of the leaf mesophyll cells examined in tert G8 mutants have elevated numbers of nucleoli.	14579127
AT5G16850	tert	No obvious phenotypic changes in the first (G1) or second (G2) generation. However, starting in G1, the telomeric smear in AtTERT-deficient plants was replaced by several sharp bands. By G2 at least 11 discrete telomeric fragments were visible.
	10611295

AT5G16850	tert-2	tert-2 mutants in the G4 generation exhibit shorter chromosomes, but also form more massive calluses, indicative of an accelerated cell cycle. These calluses also die more quickly than calluses from wild type plants.	17448460
AT5G17020	xpo1b-1(het)/xpo1a-3(homo)	embryo lethal.	18791220

AT5G17220	tt19	brown seed coat, however reduced level of flavonoids in the tapetum cells. Unlike the wild type where flavonoids are accumulated in the tapetosomes in the tapetum cells, the mutant has flavonoids accumulated in the cytosol	17307923
AT5G17290	SAIL_129_B07	early senescence; accumulation of high levels of reactive oxygen species.	19773385
AT5G17290	atg5-1	The T-DNA insertion prevents accumulation of the ATG5 mRNA in the mutants. Absence of 50-kD and a 40-kD proteins, which correspond to the sizes of the conjugate ATG12-ATG5 and the ATG5 proteins, respectively. Homozygous atg5-1 seedlings germinated and developed normally, and flowered and set seed at the same rate as wild-type plants under a long-day photoperiod (16h light/8h dark). Under a short-day photoperiod (8h light/16h dark), the atg5-1 plants grew slower resulting in smaller plants, flowered later than wild type with reduced fecundity, and showed enhanced senescence of rosette leaves. Hypersensitive to N-deficient growth conditions (mutants presented enhanced chlorosis of the cotyledons and reduced true leaf formation). Low recovery rates (20%) after restoration of N in the media, as compared to 100% recovery rates in wildtype. Hypersensitive to carbon starvation induced by darkness (plants become severely chlorotic and flaccid faster and protein loss was higher than in wild type). In C-starved plants the protein levels of ATG7 decreased and the ATG5 increased in the mutant, whereas the protein levels of ATG8 did not drop, but the ATG8 mRNA level increased, unlike in wild type.	16040659
AT5G17310	atugp1/atugp2	The atugp1/atugp2 double mutant showed extremely reduced plant growth and a delayed flowering time.	20435647

AT5G17520	mex1-1	mex1-1 plants are smaller than wild type plants and have severely reduced chlorophyll levels. Maltose levels in the mutants are 40 times above levels found in wild type seedlings. Starch levels are higher in the mutant plants, and they have reduced rates of starch degradation and biosynthesis despite the similar levels of starch metabolic enzyme activity measured in the mutant plants.	14704427
AT5G17520	mex1-2	Maltose levels are reported to be at least 40 times higher in mex1-2 mutants than in wild type plants.	14704427

	17227547

AT5G17770	cbr1-1 (FAH12)	A decrease in 18:3 content was observed in the mutant seeds, but it is much less than the decrease in 18:1-OH + 18:2-OH.
	17227547

Leaf pavement cells also have abnormal morphology. When grown on plates, chs3-1 plants display an increased freezing tolerance. Plants exhibit chlorosis and spontaneous lesion phenotypes also. These plants also exhibit increased resistance to Psuedomonas syringae.	20444230
AT5G18170	CS3975	deficient in glutamate dehydrogenase; conditional phenotype: impaired root growth and mild shoot chlorosis under intermediate/high inorganic nitrogen conditions, this is exagerated when plants are grown in high concentrations of inorganic nitrogen under suboptimal conditions( e.g. without vitamins); seedling growth is specifically retarded on media containing exogenously supplied inorganic nitrogen.	8643469

AT5G19530	acl5-4	Same phenotype as acl5-1.	10944107
AT5G19530	tkv	Increased thickness of major veins in juvenile and adult rosette leaves.  Adult rosette leaves are smaller and have more veins per square area  than those of wild type.  Increased vein thickness is attributable to an increased number of both xylem and phloem cells as well as an increased number of procambial cells in between.  Polar auxin transport in mutant stems is 66.2% of that in wild type.  Mutants are fully fertile and produce normal flowers.	15894745

AT5G19660	s1p-3	s1p-3 mutants exhibit a greater inhibition of primary root elongation in response to NaCl, KCl, LiCl, and mannitol than wild-type seedlings. The salt-sensitive phenotype co-segregates with the s1p-3 T-DNA insertion, and can be partially rescued by a 35S:S1P construct. s1p-3 mutants do not show the proteolytic processing of a 4xMyc:bZIP17 protein from an 84 kD to a 46-kD protein, as observed in wild type seedlings. In addition, several salt-responsive transcripts have more than a 2.5-fold lower transcriptional response in s1p-3 mutants than in wild type seedlings.	17662035

AT5G20490	xi-k / xi-1	The xi-k / xi-1 double mutant plants are shorter and have smaller rosettes than wild type plants. Their reduced leaf size results from decreased cell size and decreased cell number. These double mutants produce fewer seeds per silique than wild type plants. In the leaf epidermis, Golgi stacks, peroxisomes, and mitochondria move more slowly in these mutant cells than in wild-type cells. Root hair length is reduced to ~35% of the wild type root hair length in these double mutants, but their root hair density is very similar to the wild type density.	19060218

AT5G20730	CS24625	The double mutant mutant displays agravitropic responses in both hypocotyls and roots. When seedlings are grown vertically under dark conditions, the regulation of growth orientation is disrupted in both hypocotyls and roots, with the hypocotyls occasionally growing downward and the roots upward.

AT5G22000	SALK_023787C	The rhf2a mutant does not have any visibly aberrant phenotypes, but, an rhf1a rhf2a double mutant reveals the role of these two proteins in gametogenesis and protein degradation.	18552199
AT5G22000	rhf1a rhf2a	This double mutant has shorter siliques than WT plants, and lower fertility. Approximately 60% of ovules abort the megagametophytic development process at the FG1 stage. Often, one of the megaspores that is supposed to degenerate remains visible in the rhf1a rhf2a megagametophyte for a prolonged period of time. Some of the mutants arrested at the two nucleate (F2) stage, whereas about 30% developed normal female gametophytes that could be successfully fertilized to produce viable seed. The pollen of the double mutant is largely defective with about 50-70% nonviability compared to ~0.5% nonviability for wild type pollen. The pollen for rhf1a rhf2a mutants appears to develop normally through PMI, but 30-40% of the pollen grain fail to undergo this mitotic division, and then, of those that did pass through, another 20-30% never go through the next round of cell division (PMII). The variety of different ploidy levels measured in generative cells arrested at the PMII phase indicate that they could be blocked at the G1, S, or G2. Levels of myc:KRP6 increase in the double mutant, suggesting that this protein is a putative substrate of this E3 ubiquitin ligase. And many of the aberrant phenotypes observed in the double mutant can be improved when KRP6 levels are decreased by RNAi.	18552199

Earlier senescence of cotyladons and mature leaves. Pale green and smaller seeds. Delay in embryo maturation. Reduced fertility.	17189343
AT5G23080	tgh-1	Adult homozygous tgh mutant plants have a reduced stature and significantly smaller lanceolate leaves. Anthers failed to elongate and produce pollen. Almost complete infertility. At the seedling stage, tgh mutant seedlings are recognizable by developmental defects, including triple cotyledons, altered cotyledon shape, and reduced elongation growth in dark-grown seedlings. The triple cotyledon phenotype is,  however, not fully penetrant (e.g., only 7 of 362 progeny seedlings of a TGH/tgh-1 parent line displayed the triple cotyledon phenotype corresponding to a penetrance of 7.7%). tgh mutants have an imperfect vascular system  with differentiated but frequently unconnected vascular strands, which is cuased by a defect in the initiation of vascular development.	16024589

AT5G23630	mia-1	Mutant plants exhibit a severe reduction in fertility and markedly reduced size of the siliques. Mutant microspores fail to separate from tetrads and pollen grains are fragile with an abnormal morphology and altered cell wall structure. Consequently, pollen grain was mostly not released from open anthers, and those that were released, appeared as pollen tetrads. Pollen germination in vitro was very poor, compared to the wild type pollen. In addition, mutant plants suffer from imbalances in cation homeostasis.	16291648

AT5G24270	sos3-1 siz1-1	Substantially more pronounced prototypical Pi starvation root architecture responses than sos3-1 or wild-type seedlings. On Pi-limited medium, mutant seedlings exhibit an inhibition of primary root growth, an increase of lateral root development and length, and higher root/shoot fresh weight ratio than wild-type.  Enhanced resistance to Pseudomonas syringae DC3000.  Smaller in stature.  Impaired drought tolerance.	15894620

AT5G24360	ire1-1	IRE1-1 transcript levels appear to be the same in ire1-1/IRE1-1 heterozygous and IRE1-1 homozygous (i.e. wild-type) plants. However, when heterozygotes are selfed, no ire1-1 homozygous mutants are recovered.	18574595
AT5G24360	ire1a-2/ire1b-1	bZIP60 mRNA splicing is completely abolished in ire1a-2 (SALK_018112)/ire1b-1 (GABI_638B07) double mutant whereas it is still detectable in ire1a-2 and ire1b-1 single mutants. ire1a-2/ire1b-1 double mutant is much more sensitive to tunicamycin than wild-type and ire1a-2 and ire1b-1 single mutant plants.  Induction of a number of ER stress-inducible genes is much weaker in the ire1a-2/ire1b-1 double mutant than in the wild-type.	
AT5G24380	SALK_001348	Morphology and development of mutant plants grown in soil or in standard culture conditions was unaltered. When grown under iron deficiency, mutant plants were comparable to wild type control. The same was observed when plants were grown under zinc, copper and manganese deficiency. The metal content (measured by ICP-MS) was indistinguishable from those present in the wild type plants.	15255869
AT5G24520	urm23	urm23 mutant leaves produce almost normal trichomes with slight clustering phenotype. Neither root hair patterning, anthocyanin (flavonoid) biosynthesis, nor seed coat mucilage production are affected in urm23, distinguishing this allele from all other known ttg1 alleles.	19234066
AT5G24520	urm23 gl1-2	urm23 enhances the hypomorphic gl1-2 allele and results in almost complete glabrousness (loss of trichomes) in normal growth condition. urm23 gl1-2 double mutant does not increase trichomes at all in response to wounding or methyl jasmonate treatment. urm23 is dominant in gl1-2 background. gl1-2 is incompletely dominant in urm23 background.	19234066

AT5G25350	ebf1-1 ebf2-1	Double mutants exhibits a clearly detectable delay in bolting time: plants had still not bolted by ~25 days after the mean bolting time of WT in LDs.	17389366
AT5G25350	ebf1-1 ebf2-1	GA treatment did not restore a normal growth phenotype or floral transition to double mutant plants grown in SDs.
	17389366

AT5G25350	ebf1-1 ebf2-1	The double mutant is still responsive to ethylene. Moreover, inhibitors of ethylene perception or biosynthesis including AgNO3 and aminoethoxyvinyl glycine (AVG) could not suppress the constitutive triple response (ctr1).	14675533
AT5G25350	ebf1-1 ebf2-1	The mutant shows dwarfed growth, supernumerary epinastically curled leaves, early senescence, and abnormal flowers with the gynoecium protruding from the unopened floral buds. However, the phenotypes seen in double mutant plants are more severe than those seen in ctr1. This becomes apparent at about two weeks after germination, except for the reduced root growth, which is already obvious at three days after germination. Moreover, unlike the ctr1 mutation that has a reduced transmission of the ctr1 allele relative to wild-type and infertile early flowers, the double mutants have a greatly reduced fertility but can readily be pollinated with wild-type pollen.	14675533
AT5G25350	ebf1-1 ebf2-1	When germinated in the dark, the mutant display a ctr1-like phenotype (short hypocotyls, short roots, and exaggerated apical hooks).	14675533
AT5G25350	ebf1-1 ebf2-1	When grown in the light, the double mutants display slightly longer hypocotyls, curled unexpanded cotyledons, and short and thicker roots with ectopic root hairs, similar to the ctr1 mutant. Moreover, the average area of the leaf epidermal cells was reduced 5-fold compared to wild type.	14675533
AT5G25350	ebf1-2 ebf2-1	ctr1-like phenotype (short hypocotyls, short roots, and exaggerated apical hooks).	14675533
AT5G25350	ebf1-3 ebf2-3	Strong growth arrest following germination even in the absence of ethylene. Plants fail to develop true leaves.	17307926
AT5G25350	ebf1-3 ebf2-3 eil1-3	Modest rescue of the ebf1-3 ebf2-3 phenotype. Seedlings continue grow and develop at a slow pace after germination. Cotyledons partially expanded and turned pale green. Stunted root densely covered with root hair. Plants never flowered or set seeds.	17307926
AT5G25350	ebf1-3 ebf2-3 ein3-1	More dramatic rescue of the ebf1-3 ebf2-3 phenotype. Seedlings grow rapidly after germination and eventually developed large rosette of true leaves. However the leaves are epinastic with elongated petioles and small leaf blades. Produced fertile but shorter flowers and viable seeds.	17307926
AT5G25350	ebf1-3 ebf2-3 ein3-1 eil1-3	Almost complete rescue of the ebf1-3 ebf2-3 phenotype. Plants are phenotypically indistinguishable from the wild type.	17307926
AT5G25350	ebf2-1	Flowering of the mutant is not significantly delayed.	17389366
AT5G25350	ebf2-1	The mutants were indistinguishable from wild-type under normal growth conditions. However, when germinated in the dark, all three mutant alleles showed a slightly exaggerated response to ACC. Nevertheless, striking developmental alterations resembling those of the ctr1 mutants were observed.	14675533

AT5G26920	GK-075G12	cbp60g-2 plants are more susceptible to infection by Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola ES4326.  Salicylic acid levels are lower in cbp60g-2 than in wild-type following treatment with flg22 peptide or challenge with P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 hrcC.	19214217
AT5G26920	SALK_023199C	cbp60g-1 plants are more susceptible to infection by Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola ES4326.  The expression profile of plants challenged with P. syringae pv tomato DC3000 hrcC is altered.  Salicylic acid levels are lower in cbp60g-1 than in wild-type following treatment with flg22 peptide, challenge with P. syringae pv tomato DC3000 hrcC, or infection with P. syringae pv. maculicola ES4326 (only at an early time point).  CBP60g binds calmodulin, and calmodulin-binding is necessary for complementation of cbp60g-1 pathogen growth and salicylate defects. These phenotypes were interpreted as indicating a defect in activation of salicylate synthesis during a MAMP/PAMP (microbe/pathogen- associated molecular pattern) response.	19214217
AT5G27150	nhx1	Reduced monovalent cation-dependent proton transport activity.  Vacuoles isolated from leaves had a much lower Na+/H+ exchange activity.

AT5G27320	atgid1a-1 atgid1b-1 atgid1c-1	Chilling of seedlings at 4°C for 1 month effectively induces flowering of ga1-3 without GA treatment. However, no bolting of the stem or flowering of the triple homozygous progeny could be detected even after 40 days of cold treatment.	17521411
AT5G27320	atgid1a-1 atgid1b-1 atgid1c-1	The triple homozygous progeny does not germinate when untreated. However, when the seed coat of ungerminated seeds is removed under an optical microscope, the treated seeds germinate under continuous light for  3 days on an MS plate, and develop into seedlings.	17521411

AT5G27807	eep1	Flowers have more petals than the wild-type, particularly in the first 10 flowers.  Four petal primordia are initiated in the same positions as in wild-type.  The extra petals, if initiated, always arise adjacent to these normally positioned petals.  Occasionally, petals form incisions at their distal tip and adopt a heart shape.  There is also a subtle carpel fusion defect at the distal end of the gynoecium in a small portion of mutant flowers.  The organ-number defect is petal specific.  In mutant plants, the transcript levels of the transcription factors CUC1 and CUC2 are significantly increased compared to wild-type.  Overall expression domains of CUC1 and CUC2 appear to be normal.  However, during floral stages 5-7, extra CUC1- and CUC2-expressing cells are observed in the second whorl.	15723790
AT5G27807	mir164abc	Plants appear normal during vegetative growth. Phenotypic alterations start after the switch to reproductive development. Flowers have an increased number of sepals and petals. Floral organ numbers are highly variable. Individual organs varied in size. Carpels failed to fuse resulting in severe reduction of fertility. In addition, plants display a highly unequal and distorted arrangement of flowers, both with respect to the angle formed by two consecutive flowers and their distance from each other along the axis of the stem.	17287247

AT5G33340	CDR1-D	Increased resistance to the virulent Pseudomonas  syringae (both pathovars: tomato and maculicola), demonstrated by an absence of macroscopic lesions upon infection. Small lesions comprising one or a few dead cells persist in the mutant.	14765119
AT5G35220	SALK_134931	Dual phenotype, reduced chlorophyll content and gravicurvature-defective. Significant increase in anthocyanin content, abnormal chloroplasts, reduced photosynthetic capacity. Severely reduced lamellae lipid membranes in the plastids. The mutant plants have retarded growth phenotypes. The plastids of the mutant line had fewer stromal thylakoids, no grana, less starch grains and more densely stained, globular structures that likely represent plastoglobuli. Moreover, the resultant defects in chloroplast integrity undoubtedly lead to a dramatic decrease in the photosynthetic capacity, which consequently results in smaller plants and lower seed number. At the same time, abnormal chloroplasts and reduced photosynthetic capacity may create a nutritional stress response, which is marked by a significant increase in the anthocyanin levels. This finding is consistent with the observations that anthocyanins are induced by a number of environmental stresses.	15659096

AT5G46700	stm-5 trn2-23010	About 51% of stm-5 trn2-23010 double mutant seedlings produced leaves by 8 days after germination, compared to only 3% in the stm-5 single mutant. In contrast to combination with stm-1, leaves of stm-5 trn2-23010 double mutants never initiated from outside the base of the cotyledon petioles but emerged internally to the cotyledons where the SAM normally resides in wild type.

AT5G46700	stm-5 trn2-23010	The double mutant progeny does not develop flowers.	17351828
AT5G46700	trn1-2 trn2-4	No obvious phenotype different from those of trn1-2 or trn2-4 was observed in double mutant.	16531491
AT5G46700	trn2-2	Enlarged apical dome, altered in shape  and often protruding (the mutant meristem therefore contains over 40% more cells.)	17351828
AT5G46700	trn2-2	Phenotypic differences from wild type development first became evident with the emergence of the first true leaves. All leaves were severely twisted and irregularly shaped and many lacked large parts of the leaf lamina. This twisting phenotype was not restricted to the vegetative phase but involved cauline leaves, the inflorescence stem and all floral whorls.
	17351828

AT5G46700	trn2-2	The architecture of mutant flowers was distorted and was accompanied by reduced numbers of floral organs in the outer 3 whorls. This effect was least pronounced in the whorl of sepals (3.2 as against 4 in wild type) but the number of petals was reduced to 2.4 (4 in wild type) and on average, mutant flowers had only 3.5 stamens compared to 6 in wild type. In contrast, all mutant flowers contained 2 carpels such as in wild type but in 52% of mutant flowers, both carpels remained unfused and ovules were exposed.
	17351828

AT5G46700	trn2-2	Unfused carpels did not form siliques later during development. In contrast, the remaining flowers with fused carpels developed siliques which were twisted and failed to fully elongate.  However, these siliques produced no fertile seeds and reciprocal crosses with wild type plants revealed nonfunctionality of both male and female reproductive organs.	17351828
AT5G46700	trn2-23010 clv3-2	trn2-23010 clv3-2 double mutant flowers also exhibited an additive phenotype not observed in single clv3-2 or trn2-23010 plants: double mutant flowers had reduced organ numbers in sepal, petal and stamen whorls, reminiscent of trn2-23010 single mutant flowers and in contrast to clv3-2 single mutant flowers, there was no increase in the number of stamens. However, in the fourth whorl, where trn2 loss-of-function interferes with the fusion of two carpels to the single style, double mutant flowers were comprised of multiple carpels, most of them fused (73%) as typically found in the clv3-2 mutation. Supernumerary stem cells in clv3-2 mutant floral meristems therefore not only led to the initiation of multiple carpels in the trn2 background but also favoured their fusion to a single style which remained severely twisted. In addition to a style consisting of multiple carpels, over-proliferating callus-type tissue was observed at the tip of the style in all flowers.
	17351828

AT5G46700	trn2-23010 wus-1	Whereas carpels were completely absent in wus-1 flowers and only 1.6 stamens (compared to 6 in wild type) developed in the third floral whorl, all trn2-23010 wus-1 flowers developed 2 carpels, which in contrast to trn2-23010 single mutants were seldom open (33%) and more usually fused. Consistent with the increased number of stamens (4.2 on average) in the third floral whorl, the trn2 mutation may compensate for a premature consumption of stem cells in wus-1 flowers. In contrast, the number of sepals and petals in the outer perianth whorls in trn2-23010 wus-1 was closer in number to that of the trn2 mutant rather than to wus-1 single mutant flowers.

AT5G46860	SALK_075924	The morphology of mutant plants was similar and to some extend weaker than ssm plants. Ectopic occurrence of myrosin cells is found in the leaves (increased number of myrosin cells). Mutant plants accumulated abnormally abundant levels of TGG1 and TGG2, both enzymatically active proteins.	16306062
AT5G46860	sgr3-1	Inflorescence stems of mutant plants showed delayed and reduced gravitropic response in horizontal gravistimulation experiments. Ethyolated hypocotyls and roots showed normal positive gravitropism. Lateral branches grew nearly horizontally, however, no other morphological defects were detected in mutant plants. Growth rate of inflorescence stems was slightly reduced, but the overal size of the mutant plants were the same as wild type.	8819871
AT5G46860	ssm	Semi-dwarf and wavy leaf phenotype, due to the elongation of the stem internodes and leaves. Initially, mutant seedlings were indistinguishable from wild-type under continuous light conditions, but as they grow the mutant plants develop short rosette leaves with severely wavy leaf blades. Mutant plants begin flowering several days later than wild-type plants during the reproductive stages of growth. They also display more rosette leaves than wild-type plants and show reduced growth of the inflorescence stems. The height of the mature ssm plants measures approximately one-quarter of that of the wild type. In contrast to these distinct phenotypes, however, the morphology of the flower organs and the fertility levels are unaffected in ssm plants. Histological analyses revealed that the length of the epidermal cells in the inflorescence stems of ssm plants was shorter that wild type but that the ssm mutation has little or no effect on the lengths of the pith parenchyma cells. Furthermore, the length of the parenchyma cells around the midribs of the rosette leaf petioles is clearly reduced in ssm mutants, whereas the mesophyll cell size in the rosette leaf blades is unaffected.	15937323

AT5G47100	cbl9	hypersensitive to ABA in the early  developmental stages, including seed germination and post-germination seedling growth. In addition, seed germination in  the mutant also showed increased sensitivity to inhibition by osmotic stress conditions produced by high concentrations of  salt and mannitol. Further analyses indicated that increased stress sensitivity in the mutant may be a result of both ABA  hypersensitivity and increased accumulation of ABA under the stress conditions.

AT5G49020	atprmt4a-2 atprmt4b-1	These double mutants have delayed flowering compared to wild type plants when grown under long day conditions. Analysis of growth under short day conditions indicates that these mutants are not disrupted in the photoperiod pathway. These double mutants also seem to be able to respond to vernalization signals and to gibberellin. But they have an impaired autonomous pathway to flowering. FLC transcripts are up-regulated in these double mutants through an unknown mechanism. The global level of asymmetric dimethylation of arginine 17 in histone 3 (H3)is reduced in these mutants.

Migration of the male germ unit to the pollen tube occurred at approximately the same time in mutants and in the wild type. Homozygous progeny showed shorter and thicker root hairs. No other significant visible phenotype changes were observed.	14675453

Roots and shoots accumulated significantly less NO3- than wild type. Nitrate influx into roots of  mutant plants was reduced.	16415212
AT5G50210	old5	The old5 mutant has almost a 3-fold reduction in its ability to stimulate the Cys desulfurase activity of Cp NifS. But, the quinolate synthase activity of the old5 mutant is not significantly different from the wild type level of activity, most likely because the QS domain is not the site of the mutation. Aspartate oxidase transcript levels are increased in the old5 mutant. And, NAD, NADH, NADP, and NADPH levels are also increased 27 days after germination. The activity of the NAD salvage pathway appears to be upregulated in this mutant. The level of several other metabolites, including those associated with the TCA cycle, are also altered in old5 mutants. The respiration rate of old5 is elevated compared to the respiration rate in wild type seedlings which leads to an increase in oxidative stress.	18978034

Hypocotyl and leaf primordia had  polynucleate cells and aberrant cell wall stubs. In some dyc283  mutant cells, the nucleus did not divide and curved around the  branched end of the cell wall stub. Abnormally large nuclei with additional nucleoli. In a subset of dyc283 mutant premitotic cells  , MTs were mixed with condensed chromosomes  during prometaphase. Some  dyc283 dividing cells had MT spindle defects. Phragmoplasts  were often misplaced or wavy. Incomplete nematode development due to a defect in  giant cell formation in the dyc283 mutant.

In addition,  the irx8 mutants contain ~50% more xylem cells than wild-type stems at a comparable developmental stage.	17237350
AT5G54690	irx8-4	Where in wild-type roots xylem files form a closely packed array of cell  files, leading to the regular occurrence of  tripartite cell corners between xylem cell files, the central cylinder of homozygous mutant roots was disorganized and  the xylem files did not form a closely packed array. As a  consequence, tripartite xylem cell  corners could not be detected in the mutant.	17237350
AT5G54690	irx8-4	Xylem cells are significantly smaller in the homozygous mutant compared with  the wild type. The cell walls surrounding the xylem vessels are also  severely reduced in thickness in the mutants.	17237350

AT5G64300	rfd1	Increased  protochlorophyllide accumulation under etiolated  growth conditions. When  etiolated rfd1 mutants were transferred to light, the overaccumulated  chlorophyll precursor caused photooxidative  damage and the respective seedlings subsequently died. When grown in constant light or darklight  cycles, the mutant showed completely white cotyledons. True leaves were similarly bleached under  normal light conditions although growth under dim light  (520 mM photons m2 s1) results in a slight greening.

AT5G64740	the1-1 prc1-1	The hypocotyl growth rate of the double mutant, which was initially slower than that of prc1-1, strongly increased beyond day three to reach over half the growth rate of WT hypocotyls between day four and day five. Beyond day five, the growth rate dropped, but more gradually than that of the WT.

AT5G64813	lip1-1	lip1-1 seedlings are early phase mutants showing a shortened period length in DD and LL (red light) conditions using CCR2:LUC+ and CAB2:LUC reporters. The shortened period length of ~1-2 hours is also observed in assays of rhythmic leaf movements. Dark-grown seedlings subject to temperature entraining still show cycling of the CCR2:LUC+ reporter, but the period length is shorter in lip1-1 mutants than in C24 control seedlings. lip1-1 mutants do not adjust their photoperiods in response to different fluence rates of constant red or blue light, unlike wild type seedlings. They are more sensitive than wild type seedlings to resetting pulses of light during the first portion of subjective night, but their responses are similar during most other portions of the circadian cycle. The period of CCA1:LUC+ and LHY:LUC+ (morning oscillator genes) is shorter under low fluence red light in lip1-1 than in the C24 parent line. Wild type seedlings growing in dim light/dark cycles, have similar levels of morning oscillator (LHY, CCA1) genes as lip1-1, but have higher transcript levels for the TOC1 evening oscillator. Hypocotyl length is reduced in lip1-1 mutant seedlings grown under constant red or blue light at all fluences, but matches wild-type hypocotyl length for seedlings grown in constant FR light or darkness. In all comparative experiments, both the lip-1 mutant and the C24 line referred to as the "wild type" or "parent" line carry the CAB2:LUC reporter.	17683937
AT5G64813	lip1-2	Light/dark-entrained lip1-2 seedlings released into low fluence red light have a shorter period (by ~1.5-2 hours) for both morning (CCA1, LHY) and evening (TOC1) oscillator genes as determined by northern blots.	17683937

AT5G65110	SALK_006464	Lipid catabolism during germination and early post-germinative growth was delayed in the acx2-1 mutant, with 3-day-old seedlings accumulating long-chain acyl-CoAs. Mutant plants have reduced medium- and long-chain Acyl-CoA enzyme activity. Seedling growth and establishment in the absence of an exogenous supply of sucrose was unaffected.  Unlike acx1-1 mutants, jasmonic acid accumulation was not reduced upon wounding of mutant plants when compared to the wild type.	16146525
AT5G65110	acx1-1 acx2-1	Double mutant seedlings were unable to catabolize seed storage lipids and accumulated long-chain acyl-CoAs. The acx1-1 acx2-1 seedlings were also unable to establish photosynthetic competency in the absence of an exogenous carbon supply, a phenotype that is shared with a number of other Arabidopsis mutants disrupted in storage lipid breakdown. Germination frequency of the double mutant was significantly reduced compared with wild-type seeds. This was unaffected by the addition of exogenous sucrose, but was improved by dormancy-breaking treatments such as cold stratification and after-ripening.  Peroxisomes in the cotyledons were enlarged in double mutants, while in single mutants (acx1-1 and acx2-1) peroxisomes were identical to the wild type.	16146525
