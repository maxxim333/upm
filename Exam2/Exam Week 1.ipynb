    "# BACKGROUND INFORMATION\n",
    "\n",
    "I have retrieved the Germplasm Phenotype file from The Arabidiosis Information Resource (TAIR - one of the primary _Arabidopsis_ databases globally) (https://www.arabidopsis.org/download/index-auto.jsp?dir=/download_files/Polymorphisms_and_Phenotypes).  The file contains information about the phenotypes associated with certain _Arabodopsis_ mutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file is in the current folder - called [Locus_Germplasm_Phenotype_20130122.txt](./Locus_Germplasm_Phenotype_20130122.txt)\n",
    "\n",
    "The file format is \"tab-separated values\".  This means that each data field is separated by a \"tab\" character.  **There is one line at the beginning of the file -the \"header\" - that describes the type of data in each column.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first column is the \"Arabiodopsis Genome Initiative\" (AGI) Locus Code.  Locus Codes have a predictable structure\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first character is \"A\" or \"a\"\n",
    "* The second character is \"T\" or \"t\"\n",
    "* The third character is the chromosome number (between 1 and 5)\n",
    "* The fourth character is \"G\" or \"g\"\n",
    "* The remaining characters are a set of 5 digits (between 0 and 9)\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Example:  At1G22934**\n",
    "\n",
    "The final column in the dataset is the PubMed ID for the published paper describing this phenotype.  PubMed IDs are all digits (0-9) but the length of the ID is unpredictable.\n"
